### Reporting issues

1. Issues should be reported to **Github**.
1. Before opening a new issue, search existing ones. Maybe it's already been reported.
1. Next, depending on the problem type:
    * Typo. Attach a screenshot, explain what's wrong in the wording and how it should be corrected. (Screenshot key is F12).
    * Quest bug. Explain the problem. Attach **two** savegames: one where the problem can be seen right away, another one _right before_ starting the quest. Indicate if any other mods are installed, and their versions.
    * Crash. See [reporting crashes](crash.md).
    * Something else. A savegame and anything else that you think could be helpful.

**Notes:**
- The best way to get the issue fixed is to submit a pull request.
- One issue per problem.
- Attach the files directly on Github, don't use external file sharing sites.
- Some bugs can be better illustrated with a gif or a video, you can do that. Youtube, [loom](https://www.loom.com/), etc.
