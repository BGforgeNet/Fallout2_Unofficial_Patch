## Reporting a crash

- Make sure it's reproducible, otherwise don't bother. (Not necessarily 100% reproducible, but at least 2-3 times out of 10).
- [Enable debug.log](docs/DEBUG.md).
- Reproduce the crash.
- **Do not** press "OK" when the error message appears. First, press Ctrl-C, that will copy error message info into buffer. Paste this info into a text file.
- Attach this file, a savegame and your debug.log. Explain clearly what steps are needed to trigger the crash.
- If you have other mods installed, list them and their versions.
- If you updated sfall (`ddraw.dll`), indicate current version.
- If you changed any settings in `ddraw.ini` (other than enabling debug), also attach that file.
- If you used any cheats or trainers, describe what exactly was changed.
