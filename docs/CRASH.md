## Reporting a crash

0. Make sure it's reproducible, otherwise don't bother. (Not necessarily 100% reproducible, but at least 2-3 times out of 10).
0. [Enable debug.log](DEBUG.md).
0. Reproduce the crash.
0. **Do not** press "OK" when the error message appears. First, press Ctrl-C, that will copy error message info into buffer. Paste this info into a text file.
0. Attach this file, a savegame and your debug.log. Explain clearly what steps are needed to trigger the crash.
0. If you have other mods installed, list them and their versions.
0. If you updated sfall (`ddraw.dll`), indicate current version.
0. If you changed any settings in `ddraw.ini` (other than enabling debug), also attach that file.
0. If you used any cheats or trainers, describe what exactly was changed.
