## Translations
[![Translation status](https://hive.bgforge.net/widgets/fallout/-/up/svg-badge.svg)](https://hive.bgforge.net/projects/fallout/up/)

- Most translations are **incomplete**, they are provided as is. If you use an incomplete translation, you'll see bits of English in the game.
- You can [help with completion](https://hive.bgforge.net/projects/fallout/up/). For additional info, see the [forums](https://forums.bgforge.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=21).

### Installation
- Translations are **already included** into Windows installer. If you use it, no special configuration is required.
- If you install [manually](linux.md) _and_ want to play a localized version:
  1. Download `upu_v*_translations.zip` from the [latest release page](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Unofficial_Patch/releases/latest). Extract the archive, copy _only_ the desired language `dat` file into `mods` subdirectory.
  1. Change `language=english` in `fallout2.cfg` to your selected language. (Example: `language=spanish`).
