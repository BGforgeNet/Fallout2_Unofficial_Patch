This is an update for [killap's Unofficial Patch](http://killap.net/) for Fallout 2. This is _not_ an independent mod, it should be installed on top of UP 1.02.31.

### Installation
1. Start with a clean humongous installation of the game.
1. Download and install [UP 1.02.31](http://killap.net/) normally.
1. Download the latest UPU [release](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Unofficial_Patch/releases/latest).
1. Extract the archive into the main game directory, overwriting files when asked. That's it.

**Notes:**
1. UPU does not _require_ starting a new game. However, if you continue with a save from an older version, you won't see some of the fixes in the areas that you've already visited.
1. If you made any changes to `ddraw.ini`, these changes will be lost when you overwrite that file. If you want to preserve them, make sure to make a backup copy and then transfer the settings manually to the new `ddraw.ini`.

### Reporting issues
If you've found an issue:

1. Keep in mind that UP's scope is only to fix bugs. Not to add "nice to to have" things.
2. Check [known issues](docs/KNOWN.md).
3. Follow the [instruction](docs/REPORTING.md).
