{100}{}{You see a man dressed in working clothes.}
{101}{}{It's brahmin buyer. He is expecting Hal's caravan.}
{102}{}{He's smells of brahmin.}
{113}{}{Có¿, to dopiero by³a rzeŸnia! Bojê siê, ¿e w tym spêdzie nie ma kasy dla ¿adnego z nas. Ciesz siê, ¿e ¿yjesz.}
{114}{}{Có¿, ranczerzy nie s¹ zbyt zadowoleni - za ten spêd tylko 1000$. Cholerne szczêœcie.}
{115}{}{Well, you had little string of bad luck but did all right. Here's the $2000 you signed on for.}
{116}{}{Cholera, doskonale ci posz³o! Oto 1000$ premii dla ciebie. To i 2000$ razem daje twoj¹ zap³atê. Niech Redding lepiej dzisiaj w nocy uwa¿a!}
{118}{}{Nigdy nie widzia³em gorszego konwojenta. Spadaj st¹d!}
{119}{}{Too bad Hal didn't make it.}
{120}{}{Shame about Hal...}
{121}{}{Mi³o robiæ z tob¹ interesy.}
{213}{}{Damn, Hal's dead! And the brahmin too! Afraid there's no money in this run for any of us. Just be happy you're alive.}
{214}{}{Damn, Hal's dead! And the ranchers are none too happy - it's only a $1000 run. Tough luck.}
{215}{}{Damn, Hal's dead! At least the brahmin are all right. Here's the $2000 you signed on for.}
{216}{}{Damn, Hal's dead! Still, you managed just fine. There's a $1000 bonus in it for you. That and $2000 makes your pay. Redding better watch out tonight!}
