{100}{}{Widzisz technika.}
{101}{}{Widzisz technika z Enklawy.}
{102}{}{Widzisz osobê ubrana w fartuch laboratoryjny, u której wyczuwasz pewnoœæ siebie i poczucie bezpieczeñstwa.}
{103}{}{S³ucham, ¿o³nierzu.}
{104}{}{Co to za miejsce?}
{105}{}{Ja tylko czeœæ. Ja ju¿ iœæ.}
{106}{}{Co to za miejsce?}
{107}{}{Chcê siê tylko przywitaæ. Na razie.}
{108}{}{This is the computer room. That's the mainframe over there, the interface terminal is next to it, and these devices are the holotape data storage units. This is the latest and the greatest.}
{109}{}{Oh. Uh, what you do?}
{110}{}{A wiêc czym siê tutaj zajmujesz?}
{111}{}{I'm the senior computer analyst. I get to maintain all of the equipment here.}
{112}{}{Oh. Me use computer?}
{113}{}{Me no understand. Me go.}
{114}{}{Say, can I use the system for a minute? You know, check it out?}
{115}{}{Hey, nice talking to you. I'll see you later.}
{116}{}{Well... I'm not supposed to allow anyone other than trained personnel to use the equipment. It's all rather complex and delicate, you understand.}
{117}{}{Please? Me no break.}
{118}{}{I promise not to break it.}
{119}{}{All right. You can access the system from the terminal over there. Just be careful, please. They'll shoot us both if you damage that machine. Oh, the guest password is 'Snookie.'}
{120}{}{I'm sorry but it's out of the question. I'm not even supposed to allow enlisted personnel in the room let alone allow them to use the equipment.}
{121}{}{Snookie? What is snookie?}
{122}{}{Dobra. Ja rozumie.}
{123}{}{Snookie? What the hell is a snookie?}
{124}{}{All right. I understand.}
{125}{}{'Snookie' is my girlfriend's nickname. I think it's cute. That's her out in the hall by the way. She's one of the guards.}
{126}{}{Ok, fine. Thanks.}
{127}{}{Yeah... cute. Thanks.}
{128}{}{Gdzie masz swój uniform? }
{129}{}{You better suit up. Armory is down the hall on the left.}
{130}{}{Chodz¹c bez munduru du¿o ryzykujesz. Lepiej zg³oœ siê do zaopatrzenia.}
{131}{}{Kim wy u licha jesteœcie... Alarm! Intruzi!}
{132}{}{Zostaliœmy zinfiltrowani! Alarm!}
{133}{}{Liczni intruzi! Og³osiæ alarm!}
{134}{}{Shit! Get the backups started.}
{135}{}{Shut down all classified operations.}
{136}{}{Secure the system and enable all security passwords.}
{137}{}{I'm a scientist, not a fighter!}
{138}{}{Pointy end with the laser diode goes toward the enemy. Then pull trigger.}
{139}{}{Help! Help! To the computer lab!}
