{151}{}{You see one of Mordino's men.}
{152}{}{You see one of Mordino's men. He looks a little jumpy.}
{153}{}{You see one of Mordino's men. He looks nervous.}
{154}{}{You see one of Mordino's men. He looks like he hasn't slept in a while.}

{255}{}{Gdzie ciê uczono walki, }
{256}{}{Masz cojones niczym prawdziwy Mordino.}
{257}{}{Ostatnia walka by³a niesamowita, hombre.}
{258}{}{Uwa¿aj na Masticatora. On lubi odgryzaæ uszy.}
{259}{}{Fruwasz jak motyl i ¿¹dlisz jak pszczo³a. To w³aœnie ty, }
{260}{}{I used to fight in the ring, but I hurt my arm, so I don't fight no more, y'know?}

{270}{}{You got the spirit to be a Mordino.}
{271}{}{Last fight was something out of an epic, chica.}
{272}{}{Gdzie æwiczysz miêœnie? Potrzebujesz trenera?}
{273}{}{Watch out for the Masticator. He likes to eat ears... he's one sick fella.}
{280}{}{Hey, hey, hey! Chica, you need me to put that weapon away for you?}
{281}{}{Co, chcesz ¿ebym ciê rozebra³, przeszuka³ i w ogóle? No ju¿, schowaj to ¿elastwo, zanim bêdê musia³ zrobiæ siê niemi³y.}

{355}{}{I auditioned for the part of one of the major NPCs, but I only got this bit NPC part. I hope I don't get typecast.}
{356}{}{New Reno was designed by Chris Avellone and scripted by Tom French. They're a coupla sick fellas.}

{380}{}{Any news from the top, eh, }
{381}{}{When we gonna whack some Bishops, eh? My gun's getting rusty.}

{413}{}{You must be the stupidest puta in all th'world to even talk to me.}
{414}{}{Hija de puta...}
{420}{}{Naw, I ain't the guy to talk to about slaves... you should talk to Lil' Jesus.}
{421}{}{When are you going be bringing down some good-looking slaves? Sorry crop last season, slaver. Shabby.}
{422}{}{Mordinos don't need no slaves to get it on. Course if you got any you need to unload...}
{423}{}{I ain't the person to talk to about dealing with slaves.}
{424}{}{You're doin' the right thing, brushing up with the Mordinos. We're going places.}
{425}{}{How's things at the Den, eh?}
{430}{}{Looking for work, eh? Talk to Lil' Jesus.}
{435}{}{Look, I ain't your compadre, so don't be talking to me no more.}
{436}{}{Mordinos ain't got no friends except Mordinos. Blow, tribal.}
{437}{}{Blow, tribal.}
{438}{}{I ain't got TIME for you right now.}
{439}{}{Wynoœ siê st¹d.}

{443}{}{Get.}
{444}{}{Tribal trash...}
{445}{}{I ain't gonna give you any Jet no matter how much you beg. Git.}
{446}{}{Look, I AIN'T your brother, so don't be talking to me no more.}
{447}{}{Look, I need a whore, I'll go buy one. Now git, chica.}
{448}{}{Mordinos ain't got no friends except Mordinos. Blow, puta.}
{449}{}{Blow, puta.}
{460}{}{(Looks up as you approach, sneers.) You lookin' for trouble, homes?}
{461}{}{(Looks up as you approach, sneers.) You lookin' for trouble, chica?}
{462}{}{You Ramirez? Big Jesus gave me this package to give to you.}
{463}{}{No trouble. I'll be going.}
{470}{}{(Takes box.) 'Bout time. We runnin' almost outta Jet. (Sniffs, coughs slightly.) Can't imagine where it all
 goes... eh?}
{471}{}{Yeah, well, you take care now --}
{472}{}{Judging by your Jet cough and the way you're rubbing your nose, I am at a loss to say where all the Jet delivered here goes.}
{473}{}{Big J, see, he takes care of us, eh? Just last week, I caught three slaves who was dumb enough to run.
 So I gets a reward, see? Heh. And you ain't get sheee-it. You jest bend and fetch. Me, I'm a GUARD.}
{474}{}{Yeah, great. You take care, now.}
{475}{}{I wonder if Big Jesus realizes how those three slaves might have escaped under the NOSES of such perceptive, Jet-reliant
 guards such as yourself.}
{476}{}{Ramirez... be careful what you say to me, all right? Don't let your mouth get your ass into trouble.}
{480}{}{(Blinks.) Eh...? What you say?}
{481}{}{Nothing you'd understand or I'd care to repeat right now. You take care, okay?}
{482}{}{I said, "I wonder if Big Jesus realizes how those slaves might have escaped under the NOSES of such
 perceptive, Jet-reliant guards such as yourself."}
{490}{}{(Blinks, smiles in confusion.) Eh? Yeah, yeah. I'm sharp, see... per-septive... I'm a GUARD, right?}
{491}{}{Yeah, you mentioned that before. If I were you, Ramirez, I'd do all humanity a favor and take that entire box
 of Jet all at once. See you.}
{492}{}{Boy, am I glad someone had the wisdom to give you all automatic weapons. Makes me feel safe. Later, Ramirez.}
{493}{}{(Blinks.) Eh...? What you say?}
{494}{}{Forget it. Go squat on a firearm and pull the trigger, all right?}
{495}{}{Nothing. If I were you, Ramirez, I'd do all humanity a favor and take that entire box of Jet all at once. See you.}
{496}{}{[Odchodzisz.]}
{500}{}{(As you turn away, Ramirez grunts.) Hey! This box's been opened! }
{501}{}{You skimmin', homes? }
{502}{}{You skimmin', chica? }
{503}{}{No one messes with Ramirez, you hear me?!}
{504}{}{Yeah, I hear you. But not for much longer.}
{505}{}{Those are piss-poor last words, Ramirez.}
{600}{}{You delivered Big Jesus's package to Ramirez.}
