{100}{}{Você vê um barman.}
{101}{}{You see a tall man in an elegant suit. He is staring straight ahead and paying no attention to the patrons around him.}
{102}{}{Você vê um barman.}
{103}{}{This man looks stone-faced. If he notices you, he shows no sign.}
{104}{}{Care for a drink, hero?}
{105}{}{Welcome, hero. Please, take a seat in the bar.}
{106}{}{Please! Take a seat, rest for a while!}
{107}{}{Bom dia, Capitão.}
{108}{}{Vault City prevails, Capitão.}
{109}{}{Bom dia, Citizen.}
{110}{}{Vault City prevails, Citizen.}
{111}{}{Um mutante! Guardas! Guardas!}
{112}{}{Um ghoul! Guardas! Guardas!}
{113}{}{I'm sorry, but the bar is closed for the evening.}
{114}{}{The bar is closed. I'll be returning home once I finish this inventory list.}
{115}{}{Don't you have homes to go to?}
{116}{}{Welcome! We've all heard about your exploits against the Enclave. Can I get you something to drink?}
{117}{}{Awnt-awnt}
{118}{}{Desliga}
{119}{}{O que você tem aí?}
{120}{}{I was looking for some information.}
{121}{}{Nada por hoje, valeu.}
{122}{}{Heh-heh, "awnt-awnt" to you, too. Please be careful out in the wastes.}
{123}{}{Oonnt-oooont!}
{124}{}{Desliga}
{125}{}{What can I do for you, Captain?}
{126}{}{What can I do for you, Citizen?}
{127}{}{Yes? Can I help you?}
{128}{}{Awnt-awnt}
{129}{}{Desliga}
{130}{}{O que você tem aí?}
{131}{}{I was looking for some information.}
{132}{}{Nada por hoje, valeu.}
{133}{}{Yes, "awnt-awnt" to you, too. Hold on a moment while I summon the guards to "awnt-awnt" you to the front gate.}
{134}{}{Urnt? Urnt-urnt.}
{135}{}{Desliga}
{136}{}{"On tap?" How... quaint.}
{137}{}{We have mineral water, distilled water, and sparkling water. We also have several synthesized alcohols.}
{138}{}{Um... what synthesized alcohols do you have?}
{139}{}{Uh, do you have any real drinks?}
{140}{}{Some water would be great.}
{141}{}{Never mind. I was looking for some information.}
{142}{}{Nada por hoje, valeu.}
{143}{}{Very good, sir.}
{144}{}{Very good, ma'am.}
{145}{}{Which would you like? Mineral? Distilled? Or Sparkling? Each is modestly priced at five dollars a glass.}
{146}{}{Mineral, please.}
{147}{}{I'll try some of that distilled water.}
{148}{}{Set me up with some of that sparkling water.}
{149}{}{What synthesized alcohols do you have?}
{150}{}{Never mind. I was looking for some information.}
{151}{}{That's a little steep for me. I'll come back when I have more money.}
{152}{}{I think I'll pass, thanks.}
{153}{}{We have synthetic derivatives H and T, and we recently brewed an extremely popular mixture, "Alcohol-Z," which has a rich pseudo micro-brewery flavor. Each is modestly priced at twenty dollars a glass.}
{154}{}{How do you manufacture these synthesized alcohols?}
{155}{}{Uh, do you have any real drinks?}
{156}{}{I'll just have some water, I think.}
{157}{}{Hmmm. I'll try some of that delicious alcohol-Z.}
{158}{}{Nevermind. I was looking for some information.}
{159}{}{That's a little steep. I'll come back when I have more money.}
{160}{}{Nada por hoje, valeu.}
{161}{}{Would you care for anything else?}
{162}{}{I'd like some more water, thanks.}
{163}{}{What synthesized alcohols do you have?}
{164}{}{Never mind. I was looking for some information.}
{165}{}{Nada por hoje, valeu.}
{166}{}{Are you okay, sir? Drinking all that "alcohol-Z" looks like it has had some sort of effect on you. Are you sure you want more?}
{167}{}{Are you okay, sir? Drinking all that "alcohol-Z" looks like it has had some sort of effect on you. Are you sure you want more?}
{168}{}{Would you care for anything else?}
{169}{}{I don't feel so good... I'm just going to pop out of dialogue for a second and check my max hit points.}
{170}{}{No, no, I feel great! I'm just going to pop out of dialogue for a second and check my max hit points.}
{171}{}{I'll just have some water, I think.}
{172}{}{I'll have some more delicious alcohol-Z.}
{173}{}{How do you manufacture these synthesized alcohols?}
{174}{}{Actually, I was looking for some information.}
{175}{}{Nada mais por hoje, valeu.}
{176}{}{The Auto-Docs within Vault City can brew synthetic substitutes for otherwise addictive substances. As I understand it, these synthetics were used as placebos for drug addicts before the war.}
{177}{}{Você parece saber muito sobre esses sintéticos.}
{178}{}{Uh, do you have any real drinks?}
{179}{}{Oh. Bem, eu só gostaria de um pouco de água então.}
{180}{}{Hmmm. Vou experimentar um pouco desse álcool-Z.}
{181}{}{Interessante. Olha, eu estava procurando algumas informações...}
{182}{}{Entendo. Obrigado pela informação, adeus.}
{183}{}{Fui criado do Dr. Troy por alguns meses antes de ser designado para cá. Ele exigiu que eu fosse fluente com o banco de dados médico de Vault City.}
{184}{}{"Experiente?" Ele pode pedir legalmente para você fazer isso em um computador?}
{185}{}{Banco de dados médico?}
{186}{}{Interessante. Olha, eu estava procurando algumas informações...}
{187}{}{Entendo. Obrigado pela informação, adeus.}
{188}{}{Uh..."fluente" significa proficiente, habilidoso, bem aprendido.}
{189}{}{Huh. Bem, se isso faz você se sentir melhor colocando dessa forma, tudo bem. O que era isso sobre um banco de dados médico?}
{190}{}{Estava procurando outras informações...}
{191}{}{Se a negação faz você se sentir melhor, eu entendo. Falo com você mais tarde.}
{192}{}{Sim, vários dos computadores no primeiro andar da Vault contêm uma vasta gama de informações médicas. É tudo muito fascinante, embora o jargão possa ser confuso se você não tiver formação médica.}
{193}{}{Jargão? Ele é o responsável pelos computadores?}
{194}{}{Interessante. Olha, eu estava procurando algumas informações...}
{195}{}{Hmmmm. Talvez eu de uma olhada neles, então.}
{196}{}{Oh não. "Jargão" refere-se a linguagem, terminologia, geralmente relacionada a uma determinada profissão.}
{197}{}{Uh, claro que sim, claro que sim. Estava só te testando. Olha, eu estava procurando algumas informações...}
{198}{}{Se você diz. Avise esse jargão que falarei com ele, certo? Adeus.}
{199}{}{If you mean what passes for alcohol in the wastes, then no.}
{200}{}{We have never felt the need to poison our systems with those bacterial-ridden mixtures. The bar in the Courtyard might be less... discriminating.}
{201}{}{I'll just have some water, then.}
{202}{}{Wait a minute. What 'synthesized drinks' do you have?}
{203}{}{I was looking for some information.}
{204}{}{I'll go check it out then, thanks.}
{205}{}{Maybe I'll go somewhere else, then.}
{206}{}{Then perhaps you should be at our information center instead of this establishment. It is located downtown. Now move along... I have other customers.}
{207}{}{Hold on, I wanted a drink. What have you got on tap?}
{208}{}{No, I think you'll tell me what I want to know first. And you'll leave that attitude out of your voice, too if you know what's good for you.}
{209}{}{Tudo bem então. Bom Dia.}
{210}{}{Of course. What did you need to know, sir?}
{211}{}{Of course. What did you need to know, ma'am?}
{212}{}{Of course. What did you need to know, Captain?}
{213}{}{Of course. What did you need to know, Citizen?}
{214}{}{Can you tell me who Vault City's leader is?}
{215}{}{Can you tell me a little about the slavery here in Vault City?}
{216}{}{Never mind. I wanted a drink. What have you got on tap?}
{217}{}{Nada por hoje, valeu.}
{218}{}{Why, First Citizen Lynette, of course. She's been First Citizen for almost two terms now. She is still answerable to the council, but she is responsible for most of the core legislation for Vault City.}
{219}{}{Council?}
{220}{}{Can you tell me a little about the slavery here in Vault City?}
{221}{}{Never mind. I wanted a drink. What have you got on tap?}
{222}{}{Interesting. Thanks for the information. Goodbye.}
{223}{}{Yes, there is also a Vault City council. Its spokesman is Senior Councilman McClure. (Leans in.) McClure and the First Citizen have butted heads several times, in fact.}
{224}{}{Really...?}
{225}{}{Can you tell me a little about the slavery here in Vault City?}
{226}{}{Never mind. I wanted a drink. What have you got on tap?}
{227}{}{Interesting. Thanks for the information. Goodbye.}
{228}{}{Oh, yes. Recently, some Citizens have petitioned McClure and the council to override some of the First Citizen's decisions. It created quite a stir, let me tell you.}
{229}{}{Hmmm. I was curious about something else...}
{230}{}{I see. Well, I could use a drink. What have you got on tap?}
{231}{}{Interesting. Thanks for the information. Goodbye.}
{232}{}{Oh, no, no... it's not slavery. Those people you see working in the city are servants... myself included. We are treated very well here, taught to read and write, and given medical care, homes and food.}
{233}{}{Everything except your freedom, huh?}
{234}{}{If you've no complaints, then it's no problem. Forget I asked.}
{235}{}{Never mind. I wanted a drink. What have you got on tap?}
{236}{}{I see. Well, thanks for talking with me. Goodbye.}
{237}{}{If you are not going to order a drink, perhaps you had best leave, ma'am.}
{238}{}{If you are not going to order a drink, perhaps you had best leave, sir.}
{239}{}{If you've no complaints about your... servitude, then it's no problem. Forget I asked.}
{240}{}{I'll take a drink, then. What have you got on tap?}
{241}{}{Maybe I better. Good day.}
{242}{}{I shall. Now is there something I can help you with?}
{243}{}{I'll take a drink, then. What have you got on tap?}
{244}{}{Not today, actually. Good day.}
{245}{}{Zzzzzz.}
