{100}{}{Você um deathclaw enorme. O bicho tem músculos enormes, dentes afiados, e garras.}
{101}{}{Você vê Gruthar, líder dos deathclaws.}
{102}{}{You see the most impressive deathclaw you could imagine. The creature must be unique among its
 kind.}
{103}{}{Do not fear me, human. I do not intend to harm you. I am Gruthar, leader of this deathclaw pack.
 Why have you come here?}
{104}{}{Why have you come here?}
{105}{}{Uh...}
{106}{}{To kick your ass!}
{107}{}{How is it possible that a deathclaw can talk... and so well?}
{108}{}{I want to know what happened to the people who once lived here.}
{109}{}{I'm looking for something called a GECK. I was told I could find one here.}
{110}{}{I've been asked to eliminate a den of dangerous deathclaws...}
{111}{}{I'm investigating raids on the local brahmin ranches. Do you know anything about this?}
{112}{}{I think I'll be leaving now.}
{113}{}{You are no idiot, human. I can see the truth of this in your eyes. Please do not try to deceive
 me. I have no patience for such games.}
{114}{}{Very well. If you wish to be thought of as an idiot, then so be it. Return to me if you change
 your mind.}
{115}{}{My apologies. You seem to be intellectually challenged. You are no threat to me or the pack. You
 are welcome here, and may consider this place a safe haven from the outside world. Harm no one, stay
 out of trouble, and you will always be welcome here.}
{116}{}{Forgive me. I do not mean to be rude, but I do not see that this is relevant to our conversation.
 I can speak your tongue, I can read your written word. What more needs be said?}
{117}{}{Eu vejo.}
{118}{}{I don't mean to pry, but surely you can understand my interest in this matter.}
{119}{}{Yeah, well, how about letting me decide what is or is not relevant?}
{120}{}{Yes, I certainly can. Very well. If we part as friends, human, you should speak with Goris. He
 has more understanding in this matter than I. He can usually be found in the vault library.}
{121}{}{Thank you. I look forward to meeting Goris.}
{122}{}{I have no intention of adding a deathclaw to my list of friends. Bye!}
{123}{}{Tudo certo.}
{124}{}{They are gone, human. We did not kill them and take their home. It is not our way to kill. I
 understand that you may not believe me, but I hope that you will judge me by my actions toward you and
 not out of fear or prejudice.}
{125}{}{Hey, maybe you figure I can kick your ass?}
{126}{}{You seem to be an honorable being, Gruthar.}
{127}{}{Sim, eu suponho.}
{128}{}{A geck. Is that not a small lizard... no, wait... that is a gecko. I am sorry, but I do not know
 what a geck is, nor where it can be found.}
{129}{}{Yes, I believe you mentioned this once before. I do not know what a geck is, nor where it can be
 found.}
{130}{}{Will you let me in to look for it?}
{131}{}{Hey, that small lizard comment was really funny. That a relative of yours?}
{132}{}{It's obvious that talking to you is a waste of time. Good-bye.}
{133}{}{To be honest with you, I'm not exactly sure what it is myself. Would it be all right with you if
 I looked for it?}
{134}{}{I am sorry, but I do not allow just anyone to wander these halls. I am responsible for the
 safety of all who live here and I must exercise caution. However, I will look for this geck, and if I
 find it, I will let you know.}
{135}{}{I am sorry, but I do not allow just anyone to wander these halls. I am responsible for the
 safety of all who live here and I must exercise caution.}
{136}{}{Look. It's not like you own the place. Maybe I'll look around whether you like it or not!}
{137}{}{I understand, Gruthar, and I'll respect your wish for privacy.}
{138}{}{I can understand your concern. You don't know me well enough to trust me. What if I could help
 you out somehow, and in return you allow me to look around?}
{139}{}{(Gruthar stares at you intently for a moment.) You would be interested in helping us? Yes, I
 sense little evil in you. Very well, I shall place my trust in you.}
{140}{}{(Gruthar stares at you intently for a moment.) I think not. I can sense the evil in you, human.
 I cannot risk the lives of those I protect by taking a chance with you.}
{141}{}{Obrigado.}
{142}{}{Fine. I think a bullet lobotomy is a viable solution to my problem.}
{143}{}{Sorry you feel that way, Gruthar.}
{144}{}{I'll be leaving, then.}
{145}{}{There are many machines here, machines built by humans. Deathclaw hands cannot use these
 machines. However, there is one machine that understands questions. I ask it to run the other machines
 and it obeys. This machine no longer listens. It will no longer run the other machines. We are running
 out of food and water. I have ordered raids on the human lands so that we may survive. I am not proud
 of this and I would put an end to it. If you repair this machine, I will be able to feed my people once
 again. I will gladly stop the raids. Will you agree to this?}
{146}{}{Sorry, I have no idea how to fix such a thing.}
{147}{}{I'm no tech, but I can give it a try.}
{148}{}{Hmm... sounds like the voice recognition module has gone bad on you. Let's go take a look.}
{149}{}{I've changed my mind. I'll have to think about this some more.}
{150}{}{I will do what I can for you.}
{151}{}{Eu me recuso a ajudar os deathclaws.}
{152}{}{Thank you. The machine is in the vault control center on the third level. If you can repair it,
 please do so. I am placing my trust in you. Please do not betray it. You are welcome here.}
{153}{}{I won't let you down, Gruthar. You have my word on that.}
{154}{}{Thanks. I'll get on it.}
{155}{}{There really is one born every minute...}
{156}{}{I see... Well, deathclaws are dangerous by nature and great care must be taken when encountering
 them in the wild. However, I am certain that you have noticed that we are an exception. My pack poses
 no threat to you or your human communities. We have evolved beyond our base cousins and wish simply to
 be left alone.}
{157}{}{Uh... sim.}
{158}{}{Your heightened intellect could make you even more of a threat than the average deathclaw,
 Gruthar.}
{159}{}{I can see that you are not the savage killers that deathclaws are known to be.}
{160}{}{I have spent many sleepless nights, deep in thought, pondering just such issues. I have finally
 come to the conclusion that the burdens and responsibilities associated with the gift of intelligence
 are countless. There are only two choices available to any thinking being. Either accept life as it
 comes and make the best of it for yourself and others, or simply cease to be. I have chosen to accept
 the challenges of life. If this makes me a threat to humankind, then I pity the small mind that finds
 it so...}
{161}{}{Yes, well... I may have a small mind but I also have a BIG weapon.}
{162}{}{I couldn't agree with you more. I don't think you're a threat, Gruthar.}
{163}{}{Uh... yeah. What you said.}
{164}{}{(Gruthar pauses and seems to be carefully considering his response to you) I am sorry to say
 that I ordered the raids on the human lands. I am responsible for the lives of many here. We are
 running out of food, water, and other supplies. Until I can get the situation corrected, I need to take
 what I, a deathclaw, cannot ask humans for.}
{165}{}{Well, now that I know the source of the raids, I'll just eliminate it!}
{166}{}{I'm sorry to hear that. Is there some way that I may be able to help you so that you can stop
 the raids?}
{167}{}{I've heard enough for now. I need some time to think.}
{168}{}{I see...}
{169}{}{I am displeased with your decision but I accept it. You may leave, but please return if you
 reconsider.}
{170}{}{Feito.}
{171}{}{Hello}
{172}{}{No. I'll get to it, though.}
{173}{}{I'm sorry, Gruthar. The voice module has gone bad. I'll have to go get one.}
{174}{}{I do not understand the workings of such things but I trust you,}
{175}{}{Feito.}
{176}{}{I shall return, you have my word.}
{177}{}{Hello}
{178}{}{Não, eu ainda estou procurando.}
{179}{}{Yes, and here it is!}
{180}{}{}
{181}{}{You have restored my faith in humans. I thank you for all that you have done for the pack. Is
 there something that I can do for you in return?}
{182}{}{You said you would let me know if you found a GECK here. Did you locate one?}
{183}{}{Yes, I am looking for a GECK. I have been told that I could find it here. Do you know where it is?}
{184}{}{No, thank you. I have everything that I need.}
{185}{}{Yes, there was a geck in the vault storage room. It is yours with many thanks.}
{186}{}{Yes, there was a geck in the vault storage room. However, it is missing. I am sorry
 that I cannot give it to you as a reward for all your generous help.}
{187}{}{Obrigado!}
{188}{}{Uh... that's okay. I'll try to locate one elsewhere.}
{189}{}{Hello again, human. I hope that you do not intend to play the fool with me.}
{190}{}{I want to apologize and start over, Gruthar.}
{191}{}{Sorry, I gotta go.}
{192}{}{Ah, desculpe.}
{193}{}{Saudações, humano. Você reconsiderou? Você vai me ajudar?}
{194}{}{De jeito nenhum. Eu só queria ouvir você assassinar um pouco mais a língua.}
{195}{}{Não, eu não penso assim.}
{196}{}{Sim, Gruthar. Vou te ajudar.}
{197}{}{Saudações, amigo. Checou a máquina?}
{198}{}{Ainda não, mas vou começar.}
{199}{}{Olá, meu amigo. Você salvou o pacote e nós agradecemos.}
{200}{}{}
{201}{}{}
{202}{}{Morra, humano traiçoeiro!}
{203}{}{}
{204}{}{}
{205}{}{Eu não tenho nada contra você, humano, e eu não quero ter. Estou tentando lidar de um modo civilizado.
 Por favor, retribua o favor!}
{206}{}{Tudo bem, vamos conversar então.}
{207}{}{Você é um Deathclaw e essa será sua sentença de morte... Isso é tudo!}
{208}{}{Desculpe, Gruthar. Vamos conversar.}
{209}{}{Que seja. Vou embora.}
{210}{}{Não. Eu sou o líder aqui, então eu que decido. Se você não gostar de alguma coisa, pode voltar para suas terras humanas!}
{211}{}{Chupa aqui oh!}
{212}{}{Certo, já vou indo.}
{213}{}{Claro, Gruthar. Eu me esqueci por um momento.}
{214}{}{Te garanto que não estava tentando ser engraçado ou brincar com você. Por favor, me desculpe se deixei
 essa impressão. Eu te ajudaria se pudesse.}
{215}{}{Bem, valeu.}
{216}{}{Desculpe, não queria ser impertinente.}
{217}{}{Esqueça essa pose civilizada, cara. Não funciona comigo.}
{218}{}{(Gruthar emite uma série de grunhidos guturais) Posso não ser o dono deste lugar, humano,
 mas é meu lar e o lar de outros que confiam em mim para protege-los. Não me force, ou qualquer um
 de nós a fazer alguma coisa que nos arrependeremos depois!}
{219}{}{Eu sinto muito; fui indelicado e ultrapassei os limites.}
{220}{}{Aperto você e todos que se parecem com você!}
{221}{}{Ha ha! Vou sair daqui.}
{222}{}{Obrigado. Por favor, vá para a sala de controle e substitua o módulo.}
{223}{}{Considere isso feito!}
{224}{}{}
{225}{}{Você não é bem-vindo aqui agora. Pode sair.}
{226}{}{Adeus.}
{227}{}{Adeus.}
{228}{}{Feito.}
{229}{}{Desculpas aceitas, humano. Tenha um bom dia!}
{230}{}{Feito.}
{231}{}{. Você examinou a máquina?}
{232}{}{. Vou esperar seu retorno.}
{233}{}{. Encontrou a peça para consertar a máquina?}
{234}{}{Uh, tudo bem.}
{235}{}{Espero que você esteja gostando da sua estadia.}
{236}{}{Infelizmente, tivemos que chegar a isso. Eu permiti que ele ficasse ileso, desde que ele não representasse nenhuma ameaça para o bando. Mas escolheu seu caminho, espero que entenda.}
{237}{}{Voce mau.}
{238}{}{Entendo, Gruthar.}
{239}{}{Sim. Matt não é bom.}
