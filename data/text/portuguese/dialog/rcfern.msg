{100}{}{Você vê um sujeito de aparência nervosa em um macacão.}
{101}{}{Você vê Ferndown, o agente mercante de Vault City.}
{102}{}{Você vê um sujeito frágil e de aparência nervosa em um macacão sujo.}
{103}{}{Receio que não possamos pagá-lo por abandonar o trailer. Tenho certeza de que foi isso que matou Ben.}
{104}{}{Você realmente achou que eu recompensaria um ladrão? Você tem sorte de não ter sido
 linchado na trilha. Eu não vou te pagar nada. Agora saia.}
{105}{}{A thief? I resemble that remark, you damn ingrate! I'm leaving. Goodbye.}
{106}{}{Someday soon, you'll regret crossing me. Goodbye.}
{107}{}{Your caravan had so many losses that I can't think you really did your job. We can't reward that
 kind of failure.}
{108}{}{You cheap bastard! You'll pay for stiffing me. Goodbye.}
{109}{}{Well, sometimes you just get luckier than others. This was one of the unlucky times. Goodbye.}
{110}{}{We didn't quite lose everything on the caravan, but we lost more we can afford. If you'd done
 your job right, you'd be getting more than this $50.}
{111}{}{Well, something is better than nothing, I guess. Goodbye.}
{112}{}{You lousy bastard. Nobody could have done a better job. You'll regret stiffing me. Goodbye.}
{113}{}{That wasn't too bad at all. Here's your $100. It'll be a while before we get another caravan
 master, so I don't know when we'll be traveling again.}
{114}{}{I don't think I ever want to spend so much time looking at the ass-end of a brahmin again. Goodbye.}
{115}{}{That wasn't too bad at all. See you later. Goodbye.}
{116}{}{That was a good run. Might not have worked out that way if you weren't along. Here's your $100,
 plus a $50 bonus for the great job. Thanks again. If only Ben had lived to see it.}
{117}{}{Nice to find someone who appreciates quality when he sees it. See you around, maybe. Goodbye.}
{118}{}{Always glad to make some extra money. Thanks, and goodbye.}
{119}{}{I can't believe that Ben took an idiot like you in. Well, I suppose that was his last work of
 charity. You were lucky to have survived. Goodbye.}
{120}{}{Ook?}
{121}{}{I'm sorry to lose Ben Wade. He was a good man and a hard one to replace. My name's Ferndown, and
 I'll take care of what we owe you.}
{122}{}{Hã, valeu.}
{123}{}{Que pena para Ben Wade, ele era um bom homem.}
