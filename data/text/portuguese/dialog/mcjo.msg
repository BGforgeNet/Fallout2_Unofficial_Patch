{101}{}{Você vê uma pessoa comum, de meia-idade, de estatura mediana e constituição mediana. Nada fora do comum.}
{102}{}{Você vê Jo.}
{103}{}{Você vê o mercador Jo.}
{104}{}{Você vê o xerife Jo.}
{105}{}{Você vê o prefeito Jo.}
{106}{}{Você vê Juiz de Paz Jo.}
{150}{}{Nós matamos todo mundo. Até as crianças... [Soluço]}
{151}{}{Se reúna com os outros na Fazenda Fantasma. Vamos atacar imediatamente.}
{152}{}{Obrigado por salvar os moradores de Modoc.}
{153}{}{O que você está fazendo?}
{154}{}{Ei! Deixe isso pra lá!}
{155}{}{Ladrão!}
{156}{}{Desculpe, este posto comercial está fechado por tempo indeterminado devido à seca.}
{157}{}{Então, quem disse que estou aqui para negociar?}
{158}{}{Eu sou novo aqui. O que você pode dizer sobre esta cidade?}
{159}{}{Você teria um relógio de ouro para vender?}
{160}{}{GECK!}
{161}{}{O que posso fazer por você?}
{162}{}{Estou procurando um certo item e gostaria de saber se você pode me ajudar a localizá-lo.}
{164}{}{Estou querendo comprar um relógio de bolso de ouro. Você sabe onde posso conseguir um?}
{165}{}{O que você tem para negociar?}
{166}{}{O que você pode me dizer sobre essa cidade?}
{167}{}{O que você faz aqui?}
{168}{}{GECK!}
{169}{}{Você voltou! O que descobriu sobre a fazenda?}
{170}{}{Limpei seu problema com a Fazenda Fantasma. Você pode assumir a fazenda quando quiser.}
{171}{}{Tenho uma mensagem para você do líder dos Slags.}
{172}{}{Menss-aje.}
{173}{}{Fazenda?}
{174}{}{Todas as coisas ruins se foram!}
{175}{}{Eu vou.}
{176}{}{Voltarei quando tiver mais informação.}
{179}{}{Tem um pinguço no Den que combina com a descrição de Karl. Ele também diz que já foi agricultor.}
{180}{}{Esses corpos são falsos, só uns manequins cobertos com tripas brâmanes. Eles estavam lá para manter você longe da colheita.}
{181}{}{Mais uma vez, o que devo fazer?}
{182}{}{Que? Ah, você deve ser novo por aqui. Bem-vindo a Modoc. Meu nome é Jo, administro o posto
 comercial daqui.}
{183}{}{Estou na busca pelo GECK sagrado. Sabe onde posso encontrar?}
{186}{}{Parece que você está com sorte, acontece que eu sei onde está. Acho que temos alguns
 negócios para discutir, afinal.}
{187}{}{Negócios? Só me diga onde posso encontrar o GECK sagrado e eu seguirei meu caminho.}
{188}{}{Nosso único negócio é que você me diga onde o GECK sagrado está antes que algo ruim aconteça
 por aqui.}
{189}{}{O que você quer para essa informação?}
{190}{}{Ah sim, o que eu quero... Caso você não tenha percebido, nossa pequena comunidade agrícola está
 passando por uma de suas piores secas de todos os tempos. A estação chuvosa foi curta demais esse
 ano, e nossas colheitas estão mortas ou morrendo por falta de água. Sendo sincero, nossa comunidade
 está à beira de definhar totalmente.}
{191}{}{Umm... Você sabe que eu não posso fazer chover, certo?!?}
{192}{}{[Ele ri baixinho] Não, não... claro que não. Eu não pediria para você fazer algo absurdo assim.
 Você realmente não pode fazer chover, pode... Não, claro que não pode! De qualquer forma, como eu
 disse, estamos com problemas e precisamos de sua ajuda.}
{193}{}{Ok, estou escutando.}
{194}{}{There's this farm at the outskirts of town, where no farm should be. Some years back it just
 'appeared' out of nowhere.}
{195}{}{Are you saying that this farm just sprung up overnight? Yeah, right!}
{196}{}{A group of us were out hunting when we noticed the new farm. But that wasn't the strange thing.
 Soon after, some of us got together to visit our new neighbor, only to discover that there wasn't
 anybody there.}
{197}{}{Continue.}
{198}{}{After many months of trying to contact the owners with no success, it was decided that the farm
 must have been abandoned soon after it was built. So instead of letting the crops rot in the fields,
 young Karl moved in.}
{199}{}{Hmm... }
{200}{}{That's when things got bad. Karl started to tell stories of seeing strange glowing figures
 tending the crops and feeding the animals at night. We all laughed at him, thinking he was making up
 stories. Then one day Karl stopped coming into town.}
{201}{}{What happened to him? Did you look for him?}
{202}{}{Of course we did! We went up there as soon as we suspected something was wrong. [He starts to
 tremble violently.] The horror.  Bodies strewn everywhere.  Some crucified, while others were
 left to rot out in the sun. I still wake up screaming in the middle of the night from the horrible
 images I saw that day.}
{203}{}{So, let me guess. You want me to go to this farm and find out what happened.}
{204}{}{Normally, I would just leave that cursed place be, but for some reason the crops at this farm
 are still flourishing despite the drought. We'll starve if we don't get food soon. Will you help us
 rid the farm of these ghosts?}
{205}{}{Como que eu saio disso?}
{206}{}{In return for helping us, I'll tell you where you can find what you seek.}
{207}{}{OK, then let's seal the deal. Cut off your right pinky finger.}
{208}{}{Then it's a deal. Show me where this Ghost Farm is.}
{209}{}{What?!? Is that how you seal a deal where you're from? We're desperate and I believe you're the
 only person that could pull this off. So, I guess it's a small sacrifice, if it'll save our town. [Jo
 takes out a knife and proceeds to cut off his right pinky finger!]}
{210}{}{[You stop him just in time.] Wait! I see now you were telling the truth and are truly in need of
 help. I'll help you.}
{211}{}{Now, take your finger and saute it in a light garlic sauce. Very tasty dish!}
{212}{}{This farm is about a day's travel northeast of here. [He pulls out a map and points to a spot
 northeast of Modoc.] Come back when you've found something.}
{213}{}{[Jo calmly wraps his hand in a bandage and then proceeds to pull out a shotgun!] Let's see if
 you can laugh this off, smart ass!}
{214}{}{[BOOM!]}
{215}{}{You've got to be joking! I'm not going to cut my finger off. I'm desperate, not stupid! Now, do
 you want the job or not?}
{216}{}{OK, I'll do it anyway. Where's this farm located?}
{217}{}{You're obviously not desperate enough. I'll pass.}
{218}{}{What was that? Did you say GECK?}
{219}{}{Unh. GECK.}
{220}{}{Eu vou.}
{222}{}{My name's Jo. Can you say Jo? No matter; you see that rectangular thing over there? That's a
 door. Be careful not to let it hit you on the way out.}
{223}{}{[You don't quite understand everything he's saying, but you grin and turn to leave.]}
{224}{}{[He seems to mull something over for a bit and then smiles and looks up at you.] Maybe we can
 work out a trade after all. My name is Jo; I run this here trading post. I have some information about
 GECK. You interested?}
{225}{}{[You nod your head up and down.]}
{226}{}{[You swing your head left to right.]}
{227}{}{Fantastic! There's this Ghost... er, farm at the edge of town. It's about a day's walk northeast of
 here. Bad things happen there. Make bad things stop, then come back and I'll tell you about GECK.}
{228}{}{I go now.}
{229}{}{Well then, we have nothing more to talk about. The door is right over there.}
{230}{}{Yup, that's one big chip on yer shoulder. Why don't you come back when that chip isn't quite so
 big? You have a nice day, and watch out for that door on yer way out.}
{231}{}{Well, then -- welcome to Modoc. My name's Jo and I run this here trading post. We don't have
 much; just a few farms, a slaughterhouse, Rose's Bed and Breakfast, and a tannery. Just enough to
 produce goods to trade. Although that could all change with this drought.}
{232}{}{O que você pode me dizer sobre o matadouro?}
{233}{}{Rose's Bed and Breakfast?}
{234}{}{Tell me about the trading post.}
{235}{}{Where's the tannery?}
{236}{}{Posso lhe fazer mais algumas perguntas?}
{237}{}{The slaughterhouse is run by Grisham and his son Davin. It's just east of here. He makes the
 best damn jerky this side of the Rockies.}
{242}{}{Rose's Bed and Breakfast is on the north side of town. Travelers from all over come just to
 sample her world-famous omelets. Some say her omelets can cure people of what ails them. Frankly, I
 think that's just a bunch of nonsense.}
{247}{}{Just follow your nose and you'll find it. Can you smell that foul stench in the air? That's the
 tanning vats just north of here. If you overlook the smell, you'll not find a better place to get
 leather goods. Balthas can work miracles with leather.}
{252}{}{Like I said before, my name's Jo and I run the trading post for Modoc. I organize trade between
 Modoc and other cities in need of food and leather goods. But with this drought, that could all come to
 an end real soon. We're getting desperate.}
{257}{}{What do you want to talk about? The slaughterhouse, Rose's Bed and Breakfast, the tannery or the
 trading post?}
{262}{}{Well, spit it out. I can't help you if you don't tell me what you're looking for, and I sure
 ain't going to stand here and try to guess what you're looking for.}
{263}{}{I am looking for the holy GECK.}
{264}{}{Não importa.}
{265}{}{Since I rely heavily on the products of the people of Modoc, I don't have much to trade for. You
 know, with the drought and all. You still interested?}
{266}{}{Let's do some business.}
{267}{}{No thanks, but can I ask you some more questions?}
{268}{}{No, maybe later. I have to go now.}
{269}{}{Now that's a good question. Mostly, I just run this here trading post. But on occasion, I'm the
 sheriff, mayor, judge, and any other official you can think of.}
{270}{}{Wow; you must be a very popular fellow to be entrusted with all those duties.}
{271}{}{Thanks for the info; I'll be going now.}
{272}{}{Nah... I just drew the short straw. It seems I was out getting some supplies and when I came back,
 I found out the townsfolk went and elected me. Seems no one else wanted the job. Except for the
 occasional argument, I really don't have to do anything -- which suits me fine.}
{273}{}{Posso fazer mais algumas perguntas?}
{274}{}{What! Are you trying to be a wise ass? Everyone knows old Corny lost his gold pocket watch.
 He even had me search his best friend's house looking for it. If you know what's good for you, you'd
 keep your nose out of this. Good day!}
{275}{}{[He takes the message from the Slags.] What's this? It's from the people living at the Ghost
 Farm. This is incredible; have you read... oops, of course you didn't. There are still some things that
 need to be worked out between the Slags and Modoc, but it's much too complex for your tiny brain to
 understand, so you needn't worry about it.}
{276}{}{GECK now!}
{277}{}{Well, that could be a little difficult. You see I really don't know what a GECK is. But, I do know
 of a place called Gecko, I've never been there myself but I hear it's somewhere east of here. I feel
 really bad about deceiving you. I wish I could give you more in the way of compensation than this,
 but the best I can offer you is a discount on goods. I'm not too stocked up right now, but I'm
 sure things will pick up around here soon and I'd be honored to help stock you up.}
{278}{}{Jerk!}
{280}{}{I don't blame you for being mad at me, but I'm not sorry I did it. We needed someone for the job
 and you fit the bill. All I can say is "thanks," and send you on your way.}
{282}{}{Yes... faaarmm. Farm northeast. Go farm. Make bad things go bye-bye.}
{283}{}{That's great! I'll send some people over immediately to start harvesting the crops. You've saved
 us.}
{284}{}{Show GECK!}
{285}{}{Slags? Who are they? What's this? [Jo opens and reads the message.] This is incredible! They've
 been living underground all this time. They say they'd be willing to trade food for medical supplies
 and other stuff. I don't know if they can be trusted. After all, they killed Karl and all those other
 people. What do you think?}
{286}{}{All those bodies are fake. Nothing but dummies covered in brahmin innards. They just wanted to
 keep you from stealing their crops.}
{287}{}{They're extremely sensitive to light. I think a small group of people armed with flares would
 be able to wipe their whole community out.}
{288}{}{I found Karl at the Den. He left because no one would believe him about the ghosts and he was
 scared.}
{289}{}{They're holding little Jonny hostage! We need to attack now!}
{290}{}{Fake! But, I saw the bodies with my own eyes. In any case, Karl is still missing. How do they
 explain that? I won't trust them until I'm certain they are on the up and up.}
{292}{}{They said the person that moved in some years ago left suddenly.}
{293}{}{Karl wouldn't do that. They probably killed him! No, until I find out what happened to Karl, I
 don't think we can trust them. I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but we're just going to have to
 take over their farm. It's either us or them.}
{294}{}{No wait! Let me try and find out what happened to Karl. There must be an explanation for his
 disappearance.}
{295}{}{I agree we should attack! Their weakness is their eyes.}
{296}{}{I didn't agree to this. I've found out what's happening at the Ghost Farm. Now tell me where I
 can find the holy GECK.}
{297}{}{I'll give you one month to find out what you can about Karl. If you don't come back within that
 time, I'll mobilize the residents of Modoc and we'll take the farm by force.}
{298}{}{OK, one month! Don't do anything rash until then. I'll be back.}
{299}{}{I need more time. It'll be impossible to find him in such a short period of time.}
{300}{}{One month, no longer! I told you we were desperate. Our food supply is running critically low.
 We have enough for one month; after that we all start starving. I'm going to start organizing the
 townspeople immediately. You best hurry!}
{301}{}{Please don't do anything rash until I return!}
{302}{}{[Shocked] The Den! I-I guess we were a little hard on him. I can imagine what he went through at
 the Ghost Farm, with nobody believing him and all. You say he's a drunkard now, at the Den? If you could
 give him the message that we believe him and that he should come home, I would be most appreciative. In
 the meantime, I believe it's about time the Slags and the residents of Modoc get acquainted.}
{303}{}{I believe I have fulfilled my part of the bargain. How about telling me where I might find the
 holy GECK?}
{304}{}{[Acting a little embarrassed.] Um... well, you see, I don't really know anything about this holy
 GECK thing you're looking for. You have to understand; we were desperate! However, I do know of a place
 called Gecko. It's a ways east of here somewhere. If I were a betting man, I would wager your GECK gizmo
 is located there. I wish I had more I could give you, but we're still a poor community with not
 much in the way of offerings. The best I can do is offer you goods at basically my cost. But
 I'd be honored to help keep you stocked for your journeys when I have the goods and I'm sure any
 of the other residents would be equally grateful if you asked them. Thank you! You've saved us all.}
{305}{}{Well, they did kill Karl along with all those other people staked out in front of their farm.
 OK, let's do it. You've seen their hideout and seem quite capable; will you lead us to victory over
 those treacherous Slags?}
{306}{}{Of course! For such a just cause, I would be happy to help you defeat the Slags.}
{307}{}{Maybe this isn't such a good idea; let's think of another way.}
{308}{}{That's great; I'll get the townsfolk together and we'll meet you there.}
{309}{}{You saw Jonny there! We've been searching everywhere for him. Those monsters, they're stealing
 our children. We won't be safe until they're all dead. I'll get the townspeople together and we'll
 storm their hideout. Meet us at the Ghost Farm as soon as you can.}
{310}{}{How can you live with yourself? We are in a crisis here and all you can think of are your own
 selfish needs. Very well, why don't you go to Gecko; it's to the east of here somewhere. If anyone knows
 about this GECK thing, I'm sure they would. Now if you don't mind, I need to meet with the townspeople so
 we can figure out what to do.}
{311}{}{That's great. What were those things, anyway?}
{312}{}{Just a community of mutants. If they weren't ghosts before, they are now.}
{313}{}{They were ghosts. They're gone. That's all you need to know. Now, tell me where I can find the
 holy GECK.}
{314}{}{You mean you just went in and killed everyone?! I didn't mean for you to do that. You were sent
 to investigate what was happening at the farm and then return with the information. I think you better
 leave.}
{315}{}{We're going to attack, but only as the last resort. We only have a month's supply of food left
 before we start to starve. You have until then to find out what is going on. I won't negotiate with
 them unless I know for certain that they didn't do anything to Karl.}
{316}{}{We're going to attack, but only as the last resort. We only have a month's supply of food left
 before we start to starve. You have until then to find out what is going on. I won't negotiate with
 them unless I know for certain that they didn't do anything to Karl and I have to know their reason
 for staking all those people out in front of their farm. I won't deal with savages.}
{317}{}{I think you enjoy killing people just a little too much for my taste. I think you'd better leave.}
{318}{}{[Shocked] The Den! I-I guess we were a little hard on him. I can imagine what he went through
 at the Ghost Farm, with nobody believing him and all. You say he's a drunkard now, at the Den? If you
 could give him the message that we believe him and that he should come home, I would be most
 appreciative.}
{319}{}{I also found out that all those bodies surrounding the Ghost Farm are fake. Dummies, covered
 with brahmin guts.}
{320}{}{Now will you talk to the leader of the Slags?}
{321}{}{That's all I know for now.}
{322}{}{Fake! That's impossible; I saw them with my own eyes. Blood and gore everywhere. But... I guess
 it's possible, we didn't... I mean... well [Jo's face turns beat red.] We all kind of turned tail and ran
 when we saw the bodies. No one actually had the guts to examine them closely.}
{326}{}{Yes, I believe the Slags and the people of Modoc will be able to come to some kind of mutually
 beneficial agreement. Thank you for saving the people of Modoc.}
{327}{}{There's this little thing about my reward? You said you'd tell me where the holy GECK was.}
{328}{}{You need to find out who those people staked out in front of the Ghost Farm are. }
{329}{}{Karl disappeared from the farm some time ago. Find out what happened to him.}
{330}{}{Thanks, I'll see what I can find out.}
{331}{}{Não queremos gente como você por aqui.}
{400}{}{[Letting him cut his finger off] OK, now I'll help.}
{410}{}{What's the big white building in the middle of town?}
{500}{}{Oh, that's our town church. The people of Modoc built it to show their faith. Lately,
 there hasn't been much to be thankful for, so nobody attends the sermons anymore.}
{600}{}{Dearly Beloved: We are gathered here...}
{602}{}{[Jo turns some pages in his book.]}
{603}{}{OK, um... Before we begin, is there anyone in this room who knows any reason why these two
 here before us should not be joined together in holy matrimony?}
{604}{}{Do you }
{605}{}{ take }
{606}{}{ to be your lawfully wedded }
{607}{}{Then by frontier law, I pronounce you attached. You may now kiss the bride.}
{608}{}{Then by frontier law, I pronounce you attached. You brides may now kiss.}
{609}{}{Then by frontier law, I pronounce you attached. You may now kiss the other.}
{612}{}{[Bo turns some pages in his book.]}
{625}{}{husband?}
{626}{}{wife?}
{627}{}{uhhh... other? Yes, lawfully wedded other?}
{628}{}{other?}
{629}{}{Miria}
{630}{}{Davin}
{800}{}{We're gonna attack the Slags in }
{801}{}{ days unless you can convince me otherwise.}
{802}{}{We're gonna attack the Slags tomorrow unless you can convince me otherwise.}
{803}{}{We're attacking the Slags immediately! Are you in or out?}
{804}{}{Count me in!}
{805}{}{I've had enough of this, count me out!}
{806}{}{Let's attack now. The Slags have shown they can't be trusted.}
{820}{}{What can I do to help?}
{821}{}{I want no part of this. I've fulfilled my end of the bargain. Tell me where the GECK is.}
{850}{}{I'll be back when I find out what happened to Karl.}
{900}{}{Thanks again, my friend, for saving our little town.}
{925}{}{You're welcome. See you again.}
{1000}{}{You have saved the town of Modoc.}
{1500}{}{You see Substitute Justice of the Peace Bo.}
