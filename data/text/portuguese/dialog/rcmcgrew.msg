{100}{}{You see a short, barrel-chested man with a full, dark, beard. He's covered in rock-dust.}
{101}{}{You see Dangerous Dan McGrew, the owner of the Morningstar Mine.}
{102}{}{You see a heavily muscled man with a scar on his face. He looks tough and confident.}
{103}{}{If you had a brain, I think it'd just up and die of loneliness.}
{104}{}{I'll be damned. I guess evolution can go in reverse.}
{105}{}{You ain't got all your dogs on one leash, do you?}
{106}{}{I don't have time for you. I reckon you're just a few peas short of a casserole.}
{107}{}{Just a couple of clowns short of a circus, aren't you?}
{108}{}{Hello there. My name's Dangerous Dan McGrew. I run the Morningstar Mine here. What can I do
 for you?}
{109}{}{What do you need from me?}
{110}{}{What do you mine here?}
{111}{}{Você já ouviu falar de uma coisa chamada Garden of Eden Creation Kit?}
{112}{}{Why do they call you *Dangerous* Dan McGrew?}
{113}{}{O que está acontecendo aqui na cidade ultimamente?}
{114}{}{I was just moving through. Goodbye.}
{115}{}{We mine gold. Everybody wants it, too. Send it all the way to Vault City, New Reno, and even
 down to the NCR. You might say that Redding has something for everybody - that's what keeps us
 independent.}
{116}{}{Nice to be so well liked. Let me ask you about something else.}
{117}{}{I'd think that someone would try to control Redding.}
{118}{}{Obrigado pela informação. Adeus.}
{119}{}{What makes you think they haven't? Everybody would like to have Redding under their belt. My
 guess is that someone will get us pretty soon. About the only thing we can do is choose our master, if
 we want to survive.}
{120}{}{O que você quer dizer?}
{121}{}{I guess that makes sense. Well, good-luck and goodbye.}
{122}{}{I mean that we're going to be put under someone's thumb. Only a fool thinks otherwise. Our
 choice is to pick the lightest thumb.}
{123}{}{Which you've done, of course.}
{124}{}{Happy thumb hunting, then. Goodbye.}
{125}{}{You bet I have. If we don't ally ourselves with one of the families in New Reno, you can just
 kiss Redding goodbye. At least any type of Redding that I'd want to live in.}
{126}{}{O que você quer dizer?}
{127}{}{I see. Well, goodbye.}
{128}{}{If the NCR takes over, Redding's going to be put under the thumb, hard. They aren't real big on
 personal freedom. They're going to turn Redding into another splotch on the New California Republic map.
 The Redding I know will be gone forever.}
{129}{}{Hmm, what about Vault City, then?}
{130}{}{Interesting. Goodbye.}
{131}{}{Vault City? (he laughs) Those bigots would turn Redding into a slave-labor camp. They don't see
 anyone who's not one of their precious Citizens as being worth a warm bucket of spit. Spending my life
 bowing and scraping to those bigots isn't my idea of any kind of life.}
{132}{}{How's New Reno any different?}
{133}{}{Thanks for clueing me in to what's going on here. Goodbye.}
{134}{}{New Reno é forte o suficiente para proteger Redding dos outros dois. Já que New Reno está dividida
 entre diferentes famílias de gangues, é dividida o suficiente para nos dar nossa melhor chance de
 autonomia. Em New Reno, eles não se importam como administramos as coisas, contanto que consigam seu ouro.}
{135}{}{Isso também não parece muito bom.}
{136}{}{Que merda hein. Até depois.}
{137}{}{Este não é um mundo perfeito, amigo. Às vezes você precisa tirar o melhor proveito de uma situação
 ruim. E acontece que pessoas más podem ser a melhor aposta para Redding. Mas nem todo mundo vê dessa forma.}
{138}{}{Então, o que você acha que vai acontecer?}
{139}{}{Opiniões são como bunda, Dan... todo mundo tem a sua e todas fedem. Adeus.}
{140}{}{Nem todo mundo vê do seu jeito, né? Eu nem imagino porquê. Adeus, Dan.}
{141}{}{Não sei ao certo, mas as coisas estão esquentando. Qualquer que seja a cidade que tenha mais
 popularidade aqui em Redding, vai ficar com o bolo inteiro. Estou apenas fazendo o possível para garantir
 que New Reno vença. A meu ver, essa é a única chance de Redding.}
{142}{}{Como você pode ajudar New Reno a assumir o controle?}
{143}{}{Alguém ganha, alguém perde. Tchau, Dan.}
{144}{}{A melhor coisa a fazer é apenas fazer minha mina prosperar e garantir que meus mineiros saibam
 quem está pagando as contas. Além disso, o fato de receberem o molho feliz de New Reno deixa o
 lugar muito mais popular.}
{145}{}{Molho feliz?}
{146}{}{Todo mundo precisa de um pouco de alegria em suas vidas de vez em quando. Adeus, Dan.}
{147}{}{Bebidas, drogas, todo tipo de divertimento químico. Você escolhe e New Reno fornece. É
 praticamente a única coisa que alguns dos meus mineiros trabalham. Seria um inferno pagar se algo
 acontecesse com isso.}
{148}{}{Como está o abastecimento de Jet ultimamente?}
{149}{}{Aposto que sim. Deixe eu te perguntar outra coisa.}
{150}{}{Obrigado pela informação. Vejo você por aí, Dan. Adeus.}
{151}{}{No momento, quase não temos jet suficiente na cidade para deixar todos alegres. Espero que as
 próximas caravanas venham com eles.}
{152}{}{Interessante. Deixe eu te perguntar sobre outra coisa, Dan.}
{153}{}{É melhor eu ir andando, Dan. Até mais.}
{154}{}{Todo mundo está se enfiando no jet ultimamente. Parece que a maioria dos caras não conseguem
 se cansar disso. Isso os deixa felizes no trabalho, então não posso reclamar. Fazem fila na frente
 do Dr. Johnson. Se aumentassem mais a dose, eu começaria a me preocupar.}
{155}{}{Quem é o Dr. Johnson?}
{156}{}{Interessante. Deixe eu te perguntar sobre outra coisa, Dan.}
{157}{}{É melhor eu ir andando, Dan. Adeus.}
{158}{}{Droga; tem muito Jet nesta cidade, estamos nos afogando nessa coisa. Ninguém quer trabalhar;
 eles só querem ficar chapados. Não posso fazer minhas cotas de minério com metade das merdas dos
 mineiros se chapando totalmente em jet. Maldito seja o Doutor Johnson.}
{159}{}{Quem é o Dr. Johnson?}
{160}{}{Parece um problema. Deixe eu te perguntar sobre outra coisa, Dan.}
{161}{}{É melhor eu ir andando, Dan. Adeus.}
{162}{}{A maioria dos mineiros que estavam enfiados no jet. O último lote que o Dr. Johnson vendeu
 deve ter sido muito ruim, de alguma forma.}
{163}{}{Quem é o Dr. Johnson?}
{164}{}{Interessante. Deixe eu te perguntar sobre outra coisa, Dan.}
{165}{}{É melhor eu ir andando, Dan. Adeus.}
{166}{}{I don't know what happened, but most of the Jet Jocks got real sick on that last batch - and
 now they can't go near Jet without getting sick. Doc Johnson's looking into it, I heard.}
{167}{}{Quem é o Dr. Johnson?}
{168}{}{Interessante. Deixe eu te perguntar sobre outra coisa, Dan.}
{169}{}{I better be Trekking, Dan. Goodbye.}
{170}{}{Cause I'm nothing but the biggest, toughest, mine-crawling, gullywumpin', snake-eatin' buck
 in these here parts. *Dangerous* Dan McGrew; that's me, all right.}
{171}{}{I see; let me ask you something else, Dangerous Dan.}
{172}{}{You don't look so damn tough to me.}
{173}{}{Sounds like you're quite a guy. Well, I don't want to take anymore of your valuable time, Mr.
 Dangerous. Goodbye.}
{174}{}{Them's fightin' words in these here parts. You ready to back that up?}
{175}{}{Yes, I am. You've opened your big yap once too many times. Draw... pilgrim.}
{176}{}{I could if I thought you'd give me enough satisfaction to pay for the ammo it'd take to kill you.}
{177}{}{I could, if I wanted too. But I'm too busy to mess with you right now.}
{178}{}{Yeah, that's what I thought. (pause) You're yellow.}
{179}{}{I'll show you yellow... when I cut out your spleen. I'm a-callin' you out.}
{180}{}{We'll just see about that, someday. Goodbye for now.}
{181}{}{A Garden of Eden Creation Kit? Never heard of something like that. I tend to find my Eden in
 Lou's sweet arms.}
{182}{}{Isn't Lou a guy's name?}
{183}{}{I see. Let me ask you something else, then.}
{184}{}{The search continues. Goodbye.}
{185}{}{It is when it isn't short for Louisa, like my Lou's is. She runs the Malamute Saloon here in
 town. Hey, just what are you getting at, anyway?}
{186}{}{Uh... nada, Dan. Nada. Deixe eu te perguntar outra coisa.}
{187}{}{Nothing. Just figuring out something, that's all. Goodbye, sweet-pea.}
{188}{}{My mistake. Well, I better be rambling along. Goodbye.}
{189}{}{Well, one thing's for sure: I could sure use a new Control Chip for my Excavator machine.}
{190}{}{A new Excavator Chip? What's that?}
{191}{}{Let me ask you about something else, Dan.}
{192}{}{I see. Well, I'll let you know If I find one. Goodbye.}
{193}{}{Funny you of all people should ask that. There's all kinds of things going on here in town
 lately.}
{194}{}{Like I said, you should know if anything's going on here in town if anyone does.}
{195}{}{Do you mean the Excavator Chip for the mining machine?}
{196}{}{Do you mean that whole thing about the cut-up whore?}
{197}{}{Do you mean the bar brawl that I settled?}
{198}{}{I'm just naturally active, I guess. Let me ask you something else.}
{199}{}{I'm not sure what you mean, but I don't have time to find out right now. Goodbye.}
{200}{}{Yeah, I mean the Excavator Chip that you sold to Marge LeBarge over at the Kokoweef Mine. That
 was a real mistake... not just for me, but for Redding.}
{201}{}{O que você quer dizer com isso?}
{202}{}{Those are the breaks, pal. Let me ask you about something else going on in town.}
{203}{}{Shit happens. See you around, maybe.}
{204}{}{I can't believe that you let that bastard Hakeswill go free. My miners seem happy about it, but
 I'm not sure I am.}
{205}{}{It was a tough call, and I made it the best I could. Let me ask you about something else going
 on in town.}
{206}{}{Uh, I wasn't sure he was guilty. But let me ask you about something else.}
{207}{}{I don't really care what you think. Goodbye.}
{208}{}{You did the right thing by putting that bastard Hakeswill in jail. He bullied and intimidated my
 miners, but they still didn't want to see him killed out of hand. It'll be better to see him hung all
 legal and proper.}
{209}{}{It was a tough call, and I made it the best I could. Let me ask you about something else going
 on in town.}
{210}{}{Justice must be served. Let me ask you about something else.}
{211}{}{Things don't always happen the way you'd like them to. Goodbye.}
{212}{}{Thanks to your killing that idiot Hakeswill, my miners are ready to go on a rampage.}
{213}{}{It was a tough call, and I made it the best I could. Let me ask you about something else going
 on in town.}
{214}{}{That bastard needed a good killing. Let's talk about something else.}
{215}{}{I'm glad that I was there to do what needed to be done to that worm. Goodbye.}
{216}{}{You know what's going on with that Excavator Chip. I want it, and I bet you're smart enough to
 realize that Marge LeBarge wants it, too. But it'd be best all the way around if you sell it to me.}
{217}{}{Quanto vale para você?}
{218}{}{Why's it better for me to sell it to you than her?}
{219}{}{I'll think about it. Let me ask you about something else going on in town.}
{220}{}{We'll just have to see about that. Goodbye.}
{221}{}{Só quero agradecer por vender o chip para a pessoa certa.}
{222}{}{Não é problema. Deixe eu perguntar sobre outras coisas acontecendo na cidade.}
{223}{}{Você entendeu. Esses mil dólares foram muito convincentes. Deixe me perguntar algo.}
{224}{}{Sem problemas. Tchau por agora.}
{225}{}{Obrigado por acabar com aquela briga de bar sem ter que prender ninguém. Os mineiros precisam
 desabafar de vez em quando, mas nada acontece.}
{226}{}{Entendo isso. Deixe eu perguntar sobre outra coisa acontecendo aqui na cidade.}
{227}{}{Alguém precisava acabar com isso. Deixe eu perguntar sobre outra coisa.}
{228}{}{Not a problem. Goodbye.}
{229}{}{Eu gostaria que você não tivesse colocado meus mineiros na cadeia assim. Eles estavam só
 desabafando.}
{230}{}{Eles começaram a luta; eu precisei acabar com isso. Deixe eu perguntar sobre outra coisa
 acontecendo aqui na cidade.}
{231}{}{Eles precisavam de um tempo para se acalmar, você pode recuperá-los em alguns dias.
 Deixe eu perguntar outra coisa.}
{232}{}{I think I need to let off some steam myself. Goodbye.}
{233}{}{Thanks for putting those Kokoweef thugs away for picking a fight with my lads. Those
 Kokoweefers need to be put away for good.}
{234}{}{I don't know about that. They were just letting off steam. Let me ask you about something else
 going on here in town.}
{235}{}{I think that's a bit too extreme. Just let 'em cool off for a few days. Let me ask you about
 something else.}
{236}{}{Just keep an eye on your own miners too from now on. Goodbye.}
{237}{}{Didja have to lock up every damn miner in town? Who the hell's gonna work my mine?}
{238}{}{You should have thought about that before you let them get out of hand. Let me ask you about
 something else going on here in town.}
{239}{}{They went too far this time. Maybe it's best that all of you should have some time to think
 things over. Let me ask you about something else.}
{240}{}{Good question. Maybe I should see about going into the mining business for myself. Goodbye.}
{241}{}{You let that tin badge go to your head. You had no call to be killing anyone over a damn bar
 fight.}
{242}{}{Things got a little out of hand. Let me ask you about something else going on here in town.}
{243}{}{Shit happens. Now let me ask you about something else.}
{244}{}{They should have known better than to start a fight with me as Sheriff. Goodbye.}
{245}{}{Selling the chip to Marge makes her backers look better. The NCR backs Marge, and if they take
 over here in Redding, we're in trouble. Much better to back me and my pals in New Reno.}
{246}{}{Trouble? What do you mean?}
{247}{}{I don't have time for a political lesson. Goodbye.}
{248}{}{Everyone wants what Redding's got. Some folks are going to be nicer about how they get it out
 of us, though. Let me explain the situation.}
{249}{}{Vá em frente.}
{250}{}{Já ouvi o suficiente de sua explicação. Adeus.}
{251}{}{I'll pay you $1,000 for that Excavator Chip.}
{252}{}{That sounds good to me. Where do I find it?}
{253}{}{Sounds good to me. Here's your chip.}
{254}{}{I think I'll hold on to it for now. Goodbye.}
{255}{}{If I find one, I'll let you know. Goodbye.}
{256}{}{It's in the Great Wanamingo Mine just west of town. Down inside the mine there's a great big
 mining machine. You can hardly miss it. The chip's in that machine. You just need to yank it out and
 bring it to me.}
{257}{}{Let me ask you about some other stuff going on in town.}
{258}{}{If you need it so bad, how come you haven't gone to get it yourself?}
{259}{}{Will do. Goodbye for now.}
{260}{}{I've got a big pre-war Excavator all ready to run, but it's got a problem. No brains.}
{261}{}{I'd like to say that it's got plenty of company in this town, but instead I'll say: What do
 you mean?}
{262}{}{I'm not exactly picky, but I don't like the sound of looking for *more brains*. Goodbye.}
{263}{}{Its control chip burnt out, and it's not like I can order a new one. But I know where one is.
 Be willing to pay $1,000 for it, too.}
{264}{}{Where is it?}
{265}{}{If you need it so bad, how come you haven't gone to get it yourself?}
{266}{}{I'm packed to the gills with quests already. Sorry, pal. Goodbye.}
{267}{}{Plenty of reasons, most of 'em hungry and nasty. Wanamingo mine's just chock-full of hungry
 Wanamingos.}
{268}{}{What the hell is a Wanna-mingle?}
{269}{}{Oh, I see. Well, that explains it then. I'll think about it. Goodbye.}
{270}{}{It's just the orneriest, nastiest, most vicious critter I think I've ever seen. It's got teeth
 four inches long. Oh, I mean four-teen inches long. But I think you can handle it.}
{271}{}{Yeah, right. I'll think about it. Goodbye.}
{272}{}{That sounds scary. I don't think that's a job for me. My knees are knocking.}
{273}{}{You do that. $1,000 isn't chump-change, pal.}
{274}{}{Let me ask you about some other stuff going on in town.}
{275}{}{I'll think it over. I can always use some extra cash.}
{276}{}{I guess I was wrong when I thought you had what it takes. Get out of here; you're waistin' my time.}
{277}{}{Ye', yes, sir. I'm leaving now, sir.}
{278}{}{We all make mistakes, bub. Goodbye.}
{279}{}{Heck... if I were you, I'd buy the deed to the place, clear it out, and sell it back to Mayor
 Ascorti. He's the deed-holder now.}
{280}{}{Take care of yourself. I really need that chip.}
{281}{}{Let me ask you about some other stuff going on in town.}
{282}{}{Obrigado pela dica. Tchau.}
{283}{}{"Painless" Doc Johnson is our town quack. Oh, I suppose he knows something about doctoring, but
 I don't guess he knows too much. He's on the west side of Downtown. Anyhow, he usually sells all the
 medicine and drugs that we get here in town.}
{284}{}{He sells all of it?}
{285}{}{I'll see you later, Dan. Goodbye.}
{286}{}{Yeah, well, when we get Jet in it's often sent in bulk, and so he fills the ampoules. Folks trust
 him to do it. Makes a big show about it being all clean and all. Simple remedies for simple minds, I say.}
{287}{}{Ahh. Let me ask you about something else, then.}
{288}{}{Thanks for the information, Dan. Goodbye.}
{289}{}{Mister, you ain't getting but two things from me. Jack and shit, and Jack's left town. Now get
 out of my sight.}
{290}{}{Little Missy, you ain't getting but two things from me. Jack and shit, and Jack's left town. Now
 get out of my sight.}
{291}{}{Ah, come on. I'm sorry. Just tell me what I need to know.}
{292}{}{You want some of me? Come get some.}
{293}{}{I'm leaving, and happy to do it. Goodbye.}
{294}{}{You should have thought about that before you made things get out of hand. Fuck you, and get
 out of my office.}
{295}{}{You sure talk tough.}
{296}{}{I'm leaving. Don't get all lathered up over it. Goodbye.}
{297}{}{Nobody says that to Dan McGrew and walks away from it.}
{298}{}{Watch me.}
{299}{}{Yeah, I bet..."Dangerous Dan."}
{300}{}{Sorry, Dan; I didn't mean anything by it. I was just k-kidding. Yeah, that's it. Goodbye.}
