{100}{}{You see Louis Salvatore.}
{150}{}{You see an elderly, well-dressed gentleman. He is carrying an oxygen tank, and he seems
 to have difficulty breathing.}
{151}{}{You see Louis Salvatore. He is carrying an oxygen tank, and he seems
 to have difficulty breathing.}
{200}{}{*Tosse*}
{201}{}{:Sibilos::}
{202}{}{*Tosse* *Tosse*}
{210}{}{Guards! Gu...*cough* *cough*...Guards!}
{215}{}{(Salvatore turns to you with a stone-faced expression. He studies you for a fraction
 of a second, then makes a strange motion with his hand. Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)}
{216}{}{Owwww! Turn down sound! Hurt ears! HURT EARS!}
{217}{}{ME CANT TALK OVER RINGING. TURN OFF, WE TALK}
{218}{}{I'm gonna CRIPPLE you, old man! You'll never walk again!}
{219}{}{Eu sabia que deveria conseguido uma permissão primeiro...}
{220}{}{Merda!}
{221}{}{Uh, please tell me that was room service.}
{230}{}{(The elderly man looks up at you. His face is gaunt and covered with liver spots. He is holding
 a breathing mask, which is connected to an oxygen tank by his side.) What... do you want of me?}
{231}{}{Eu quero... não sei o que eu quero}
{232}{}{Me want}
{233}{}{Eu}
{234}{}{Sair andando}
{235}{}{I have information for you.}
{236}{}{I have information for you, Mr. Salvatore.}
{237}{}{Estou à procura de trabalho.}
{238}{}{Mr. Salvatore, you have a reputation for strength and fairness. I want to work for you.}
{239}{}{I wanted to know where you get the lightbringers.}
{240}{}{Word is you had Mr. Wright's son poisoned. Why?}
{241}{}{I think I've entered the wrong room. Pardon me.}
{250}{}{I have told you the reason the boy was killed. It will not leave this room. (Salvatore
 makes a strange motion with his hand. Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)}
{251}{}{(Salvatore studies you for a fraction of a second in disgust, then makes a strange motion with his hand.
 Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)}
{254}{}{I'm gonna CRIPPLE you, old man! You'll never walk again!}
{270}{}{(Takes a deep breath from his mask, then shakes his head.) You have
 nothing... that I need to know, }
{271}{}{Um, I don't recall introducing myself. How do you know my name?}
{272}{}{Certo. Então, estou procurando um emprego.}
{276}{}{Na verdade, acho que entrei no quarto errado. Perdão.}
{290}{}{(Looks at you silently for a minute. He might be either amused at your question
 or irritated... it's hard to tell.) Again, }
{291}{}{Um... hum. Bem, uh, estou procurando um emprego.}
{305}{}{(Takes a breath from the oxygen mask, then gives a slight smile.) Of... course you
 are. And WHY should I hire you?}
{306}{}{Well, why not? Name a job, I'll do it. I'm hard-working, and I got the skills to
 get things done.}
{307}{}{Whoa. Did I say I was looking for work? I meant to say I was leaving.}
{315}{}{(Takes a breath from the oxygen mask, then gives a slight smile.) Of... course. But
 I require a... token of your good faith. A sample of your... willingness to work for me.}
{316}{}{O que você quer que eu faça?}
{317}{}{O que quer que eu faça, Sr. Salvatore?}
{325}{}{(Shakes his head slightly.) Your naiveté has... no place here. Words are not
 sufficient: You wish to work for Louis Salvatore? Then I must know how much I can rely on you.}
{326}{}{Olha, você PODE contar comigo.}
{327}{}{Me deixe demonstrar, Sr. Salvatore. Me designe uma tarefa.}
{335}{}{(Takes a deep breath from the oxygen mask.) There is... a man... who
 has used his... skill with cards to rob me. The sum is... trivial. The insult is not. I want him killed and
 the money he stole returned.}
{336}{}{Quem é esse ladrão?}
{338}{}{Quanto ele roubou?}
{339}{}{Pode ser uma tarefa difícil. Posso ter uma daquelas armas a laser que sua família usa?}
{340}{}{Uh, eu não faço esse tipo de contrato. Vou indo agora.}
{350}{}{Mason te dará... os detalhes. (Acena com a cabeça para a saída.) Vá agora.}
{351}{}{Tudo certo.}
{352}{}{Thank you, Mr. Salvatore. I will go ask Mason.}
{360}{}{Então você não tem... nenhuma utilidade para mim. Saia agora.}
{361}{}{Eh, um minuto... eu mudei de ideia. Farei isso.}
{362}{}{Saia tranquilamente.}
{370}{}{(Narrows his eyes. His next words are delivered in a rasping hiss.)
 ::You have not yet PROVEN yourself.:: Now go see Mason. He will have the... details of your assignment.}
{371}{}{Tudo bem então. Esqueça as pistolas por enquanto.}
{372}{}{Eu entendo, Sr. Salvatore. Perdoe minha pergunta. Vou ver Mason.}
{373}{}{Look: If you aren't going to arm me properly, then I can't continue working for you.}
{380}{}{Talk to Mason. He will have the... details of your assignment.}
{385}{}{(Salvatore looks up at you, takes a breath from the mask.) Have... you disposed of the thief?}
{386}{}{Não... Lloyd deixou a cidade com o dinheiro.}
{387}{}{Yep. The vultures are probably shitting pieces of him out right now.}
{388}{}{Ainda não.}
{389}{}{No, Mr. Salvatore. Lloyd left town with the money.}
{390}{}{Yes. I made an example of him, Mr. Salvatore.}
{391}{}{Ainda não, Sr. Salvatore.}
{400}{}{Yet... you told Mason that you had taken care of the assignment.}
{401}{}{Bem, sim, mas...}
{405}{}{(Puts his fingers together.) And... the money. Has it been recovered?}
{406}{}{Não, não consegui encontrar o dinheiro.}
{407}{}{Não, Lloyd já gastou o dinheiro.}
{408}{}{Sim.}
{410}{}{Não, Sr. Salvatore, não consegui encontrar o dinheiro.}
{411}{}{Não, Sr. Salvatore, Lloyd já gastou o dinheiro.}
{412}{}{Sim, Sr. Salvatore.}
{420}{}{Your instructions were to recover the money he stole.
 Have you not done this?}
{421}{}{Well, no, because --}
{422}{}{Uh, I have the money --}
{423}{}{Well, you see, I don't --}
{430}{}{I will take the money now.}
{431}{}{Bom, não tenho isso comigo...}
{432}{}{Give him 250 chips.}
{433}{}{Give him 500 chips.}
{434}{}{Give him 750 chips.}
{435}{}{Give him 1000 chips.}
{436}{}{Give him 1000 chips. (This is the correct amount.)}
{437}{}{(Make a break for it.)}
{450}{}{This amount... is not the amount that was stolen
 from me. Perhaps you don't know how much was stolen from me. Or perhaps you are holding
 out on me. Either way...}
{451}{}{Oh, bem, acho que calculei errado...}
{455}{}{(Salvatore nods as you give him the money, but he holds up his hands halfway
 through the transaction.) The... remaining half is yours.}
{456}{}{Ei, obrigado.}
{468}{}{Obrigado, Sr. Salvatore.}
{475}{}{(Mr. Salvatore takes a breath from the mask.) I have another... matter that requires your attention.}
{476}{}{Sure, why not? What's the job -- another kill and fetch assignment?}
{477}{}{I am interested in the job, Mr. Salvatore. What do you want me to do?}
{478}{}{Não, já chega dos trabalhos de assassinato. Estou dando uma pausa.}
{479}{}{Não há mais trabalho para mim, Sr. Salvatore. Eu preciso ir.}
{485}{}{A constituent in my... district has not paid me... tribute... for the services I provide.
 Collect it. If he objects, inform him you are my... representative in this matter. Talk to
 Mason for the details.}
{487}{}{Sim, Sr. Salvatore. Eu vou vê-lo.}
{488}{}{Não, obrigado, não faço trabalhos de extorsão.}
{495}{}{Você está... mentindo para mim. Eu sei que ele ainda vive.}
{500}{}{Você fez como eu pedi?}
{501}{}{Yes, Mr. Salvatore, I have the tribute you asked me to collect.}
{502}{}{Sim, o 'tributo' está bem aqui.}
{503}{}{Not yet. I haven't got the old guy to cough it up yet.}
{504}{}{Not yet, Mr. Salvatore. When I return, I shall have it with me.}
{515}{}{You told Mason you had collected my tribute. Have you not done this?}
{525}{}{Muito bem. (Ele espera.)}
{527}{}{Dê a ele 900 tampas.}
{528}{}{Dê a ele 800 tampas.}
{529}{}{Na verdade, eu não tenho o tributo PARA mim...}
{540}{}{This amount... is not the amount that was stolen
 from me. Perhaps you don't know how much the required tribute is. Or perhaps you are
 holding out on me. Either way...}
{545}{}{(Salvatore nods as you give him the money.) You have done... well. You have
 earned 25% of the cut.}
{546}{}{(Salvatore nods as you give him the money.) You have done... adequately. You have
 earned 10% of the cut.}
{555}{}{(Takes a breath from his mask.) You have... done as I asked. I have no
 further need of your... services. (Points to the exit.) Leave now.}
{556}{}{Hum... ok.}
{557}{}{Eu poderia ter uma dessas pistolas a laser como parte do meu pagamento antes de ir?}
{565}{}{(Takes a deep breath from the mask.) I have another... matter that I could
 use your assistance with.}
{566}{}{Sure, why not? What's the job - more extortion?}
{568}{}{No, I'm done doing extortion jobs. I'm making a clean break.}
{575}{}{A... sensitive transaction will be taking place soon. I am in need of an extra... guard
 to insure that the transaction goes smoothly. You will speak with Mason and do as he directs you.}
{576}{}{Qual é essa transação?}
{577}{}{Onde está ocorrendo essa transação?}
{578}{}{Posso ter uma dessas armas a laser que você usa?}
{579}{}{I can't do this mission right now, Mr. Salvatore. I must be going.}
{585}{}{Mason te dará... os detalhes. Vá agora.}
{595}{}{Yesss. This time, yes. But you will
 carry other armaments as well. Talk to Mason about the details. He will give you
 one of the lightbringers.}
{596}{}{De acordo, então.}
{605}{}{Sente, }
{607}{}{Ficaria honrado, Sr. Salvatore.}
{608}{}{Não posso, tenho outras obrigações. Mas agradeço oferta.}
{610}{}{I would be honored, Mr. Salvatore, but I cannot. I have other duties to another
 family... notably, my mother.}
{615}{}{That is... unfortunate. I cannot take the risk that you will remain... silent about
 what you have seen in the desert. Goodbye, }
{616}{}{Opa! Espere um minuto...!}
{617}{}{Oh yeah? Bring it on so I can slaughter your entire family, one by one.}
{620}{}{Muito bem. Você deve escolher um nome...}
{621}{}{E se...}
{630}{}{(Nods) That is a... good name. Now go speak to Mason. He will have...
something for you.}
{640}{}{Saudações,}
{645}{}{I have no further need of your services, }
{650}{}{...}
{651}{}{...hurkkk...}
{652}{}{...*suspiro*...eu...*tosse*...*respiração*...}
{653}{}{...não...eu...*hurrkkk*}
{654}{}{...socorro...*suspiro*...por favor...}
{655}{}{...Tenha... piedade...}
{656}{}{*chiado*}
{657}{}{...eu...}
{658}{}{...eu...}
{659}{}{::Para de respirar.::}
{660}{}{Heh heh. Adoro matar velhos.}
{675}{}{(Mr. Salvatore looks at you for a long time in silence, then speaks.) We
 Salvatores... we will rule New Reno. If a child must die to insure that, it will
 be... done. There is no other reason.}
{676}{}{What did killing Wright's son have to do with ruling New Reno? That makes no SENSE.}
{677}{}{You murdered someone's SON, Salvatore. You might as well have just signed
 your own death warrant...}
{678}{}{All right then. I just wanted to know why you did it.}
{800}{}{Você assassinou Don Salvatore.}
{825}{}{Você derrotou Don Salvatore.}
{850}{}{Você resolveu a "situação" de Lloyd.}
{875}{}{Você recolheu o tributo do Sr. Salvatore.}
{900}{}{You have become a made man of the Salvatore family.}
{925}{}{You have successfully completed the secret transaction.}
{5233}{}{! Quem você}
{5270}{}{. Agora... o que quer de mim?}
{5290}{}{: O que... você quer de mim?}
{5605}{}{. You have done... all I have asked. I would like you to join the Salvatore Family
 and become... one of my made men.}
{5640}{}{.}
{5645}{}{.}
