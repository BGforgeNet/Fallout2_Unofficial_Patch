{100}{}{Você vê um cientista.}
{150}{}{You see a stern-looking man with a clipboard and a hypodermic. He ignores you.}
{151}{}{He looks extremely tired and irritable.}
{152}{}{You see a tired -looking woman. She is checking a clipboard and looking around as
 if she has forgotten something.}
{153}{}{She is filling a hypodermic, grumbling slightly to herself.}
{154}{}{Hello Myron, sir.}
{155}{}{Myron... sir, do you have a minute...?}
{156}{}{Sabe quando os novos escravos chegarão, Myron, senhor?}
{157}{}{Myron... sir, these new results are very promising...}
{158}{}{Myron? A minute of your time, sir?}
{159}{}{Where the hell is Myron...}
{160}{}{Traga o Myron aqui. Ele tem que ver isso.}
{161}{}{Bem que esses escravos poderiam calar a boca…}
{162}{}{Where did I leave that syringe...}
{163}{}{Has anyone seen Subject 31? He was here just a second ago.}
{164}{}{Os escravos tomaram mais do Jet Beta?}
{165}{}{Resultados dos testes com o Jet Beta são muito promissores, mas…}
{166}{}{O estado de êxtase dura de 15 min a uma hora... calculando um dose/hora... hmmmnnn.}
{167}{}{Subject 12 still keeps having bleeding in the lungs...}
{168}{}{That's the fifth time Subject 12 has had seizures... up the dose, see what happens...}
{169}{}{Bem, que TIPO de alucinações ele estava tendo?}
{170}{}{Cheque o batimento cardíaco deste aqui. Se ainda estiver em limites toleráveis, aumente a dose.}
{171}{}{Por que a escrava no grupo de controle se matou? Nós nem a estávamos testando!}
{200}{}{Tests are proceeding as scheduled, Myron.}
{201}{}{This new strain of Jet is extremely addictive, sir. The slaves are almost
 willing to kill each other for it.}
{202}{}{The slaves would rather take Jet than eat, it's so potent.}
{203}{}{Quem são estas pessoas com você, Myron? Novos escravos?}
{204}{}{The third test group seem to be doing the best of all the groups, Myron, sir.}
{205}{}{Myron, I think the next test group should include at least three children, sir.}
{206}{}{Myron, sir, Subject 46 had a heart attack; we are restricting doses to six times
 a day from now on.}
{207}{}{Myron? We need a new shipment of hypodermics from Vault City, soon. We can't
 keep re-using these.}
{208}{}{Myron, at last! Any more word when new slaves will be delivered, sir?}
{209}{}{Myron, sir, we moved three slaves from the control group into the test group because
 of those respiratory failures we had last week.}
{210}{}{Myron, sir... we had to shoot one slave for trying to escape. What a waste.}
{211}{}{Myron... this new mild hallucinogen you've developed is promising, but it is not as addictive as Jet...}
{212}{}{If you have any suggestions, please write it on a piece of paper and then put it right
 in the trash bin over there.}
{213}{}{Yes, yes, what?}
{214}{}{We won't be able to get results if you keep interrupting us.}
{215}{}{Seems they let everyone and their mother run through here nowadays...}
{216}{}{O que você quer?}
{217}{}{Please excuse me, *I* have work to do.}
{218}{}{If you have questions, talk to the guards, not me.}
{219}{}{Yes, I'm certain that whatever you need is of *great* importance, but I have duties
 of my own.}
{220}{}{Are you authorized to be in here?}
{221}{}{Who allowed you in here?}
{222}{}{When Myron hears strangers were entering the lab...}
{223}{}{Do you have those test results I asked for... oh, sorry. Thought you were a lab tech.}
{224}{}{Too busy to talk right now, sorry.}
{225}{}{Need a new crop of slaves soon... these ones are running out of steam.}
