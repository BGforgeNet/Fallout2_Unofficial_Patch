{113}{}{Não.}
{114}{}{I think you'll be pleased with my selection. Take your time and examine things.}
{115}{}{Ok.}

{124}{}{I'm sorry but I'm closed. I open at around 8. Come back then if you want something.}
{125}{}{Ok.}
{126}{}{I'll not sell to you. Get out of my shop!}
{127}{}{Ok.}
{128}{}{I hope that shipment comes in soon.}
