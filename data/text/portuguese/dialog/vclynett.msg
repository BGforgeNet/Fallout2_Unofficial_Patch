{100}{}{You see a stern-looking woman with thick glasses, wearing a Vault City jumpsuit. Judging from her bearing, she seems important.}
{101}{}{You see First Citizen Lynette. She looks preoccupied.}
{102}{}{You see First Citizen Lynette. She looks preoccupied.}
{103}{}{It is late. Schedule an appointment for tomorrow morning, and I will receive you then.}
{104}{}{As I SAID, I don't receive visitors this late. MOST Citizens have retired to bed by this time.}
{105}{}{Schedule an appointment for tomorrow morning. I will receive you then.}
{106}{}{I will speak with you TOMORROW.}
{107}{}{I don't know how you got past the guards and into my private chambers, but you had best leave.}
{108}{}{I don't know what you intend to gain by clicking on me, but I won't tolerate it much longer.}
{109}{}{Perhaps you find clicking on me... amusing. Perhaps you will find the Corrections Center just as humorous.}
{110}{}{I appreciate your attention, but I really am quite dangerous when riled.}
{111}{}{I am the First Citizen! I must have my sleep!}
{112}{}{Leave!}
{113}{}{Cai fora!}
{114}{}{Fora! Fora! Fora!}
{115}{}{Admiro sua persistência. Gostaria de admirá-la à distância.}
{116}{}{Isso é algum tipo de tentativa desajeitada de me deixar saber que você está atraído por mim?}
{117}{}{Você gosta dos meus pequenos dreadlocks? Acho que Scott Rodenhizer tem um estranho senso de humor.}
{118}{lyn002}{A notícia de sua ação corajosa se espalhou rapidamente. É verdade? O governo ainda estava travando uma guerra?}
{119}{}{Ghu? Guer-rra?}
{120}{}{Sim. Eles iam usar um vírus para exterminar toda a vida. Eles planejaram recomeçar a
 terra... custando tudo que você construiu aqui.}
{121}{}{Você ouviu errado. Sou apenas um viajante, nada mais... e com certeza nenhum herói. Agora
 eu só gostaria de ser deixado em paz e vagar pelos desertos em busca do meu lugar neste novo mundo. Adeus, Primeira Cidadã... para sempre.}
{122}{lyn003}{Mesmo nas coisas mais simples (e você certamente é) a grandeza pode surgir.
 Tenha cuidado, meu doce idiota... toda Vault City agradece.}
{123}{}{(Te abraça.)}
{124}{}{Oh. Tchauzinho.}
{125}{lyn004}{Awwwwww... lá, lá. Sempre que precisar de um abraço, venha ver a tia Lynette, certo?}
{126}{}{Oookay.}
{127}{}{Tchau-tchau.}
{128}{lyn005}{Que insensível! Que cruel! Eles não sabiam da comunidade que construímos aqui?}
{129}{}{Talvez uma importante lição possa ser aprendida aqui, Lynette. Isolado do mundo, o
 governo estava preparado para os destruir sem ao menos reconhecer o valor de sua comunidade. Talvez
 Vault City devesse dar outra olhada no mundo exterior... e seu lugar nele.}
{130}{}{Insensível, cruel... talvez. Tudo o que sei é que eu tinha poder de fogo superior. Adeus, Primeira Cidadã.}
{131}{lyn006}{Isso pode ser um bom argumento. Da próxima vez, devemos fazer um esforço maior para
 encontrar esses remanescentes do governo e nos aliar a eles. Ouvi dizer que eles têm uma grande e forte armadura.}
{132}{}{Mas que po... oh, esquece. Boa sorte, Primeira Cidadã.}
{133}{}{Você não sabe nem a metade, Primeira Cidadã! Direção hidráulica, reciclagem de fluidos
 corporais, exterior ameaçador... muito legal.}
{134}{}{Adeus, Primeira Cidadã. Devo retornar ao mundo exterior... e encontrar meu lugar nele.}
{135}{lyn007}{Por favor, me chame de Lynette. Viaje com cuidado... meu amigo, nunca te
 esqueceremos. Você sempre terá um lar aqui dentro dos muros de Vault City.}
{136}{}{Obrigado... Lynette.}
{137}{}{Sim, bem, é melhor eu ter uma casa aqui. Com essas roupinhas novas e meu poder de fogo superior,
 levaria cinco segundos para eu massacrar todos nesta distopia atrasada. Durma tranquila, Lynette. Ha Ha Ha Ha.}
{138}{lyn008}{Você está vestindo uma roupa da Vault! Nunca imaginei que encontraria um habitante de
 outra Vault. Este Vault 13... onde está localizado?}
{139}{}{Hunh?}
{140}{}{Valt! Valt!}
{141}{}{Eh divertiiido.}
{142}{}{Tchauzinho}
{143}{}{Não é esta a Vault de onde meu ancestral originalmente veio?}
{144}{}{Não sei. Venho de uma aldeia no oeste.}
{145}{}{Não sei. Estou tentando encontrar a Vault de onde meu ancestral veio... você pode me ajudar?}
{146}{}{Não tenho tempo para explicar toda a história agora. Bom dia.}
{147}{lyn009}{Esse deve ser o seu QI no seu macacão, não o número da Vault.}
{148}{}{Hrnnnn?}
{149}{}{Nuuuumero}
{150}{}{Eh Leeegal!}
{151}{}{Desliga}
{152}{lyn010}{Eu não sei como você reuniu cérebro suficiente para entrar na cidade, mas vou me certificar
 de que você não fique vagando por aqui novamente... guardas! Escolte esse imbecil para fora dos muros!}
{153}{}{NÃO!}
{154}{}{ ir com pessoas de metal}
{155}{lyn011}{Bom dia para você, estranho. Eu sou a Primeira Cidadã, Lynette. Posso perguntar sobre quais negócios te trazem aqui?}
{156}{}{Neeegocios? Neeego-cios?}
{157}{}{Eer!}
{158}{}{Tchau-tchau.}
{159}{}{Estou procurando um Kit de Criação do Jardim do Éden. Você tem um?}
{160}{}{Estou em busca de um Kit de Criação do Jardim do Éden, Primeira Cidadã. Sua cidade tem algum que eu possa comprar?}
{161}{}{Você é a... Supervisora desta Vault?}
{162}{}{Desculpe minha ignorância, Primeira Cidadã... o título "Primeira Cidadã" significa que você é o Supervisora desta vault?}
{163}{}{Aqui é Vault City? Por que você não mora em uma vault?}
{164}{}{Nenhum negócio hoje. Talvez outra hora.}
{165}{}{Nothing today. My apologies for disturbing you, First Citizen. Good day.}
{166}{lyn012a}{Where did one such as YOU hear of a Garden of Eden Creation Kit?}
{167}{lyn012b}{Such technology is not meant for Outsiders.}
{168}{}{You got a PROBLEM with Outsiders, woman?}
{169}{}{You got a PROBLEM with Outsiders?}
{170}{}{My apologies... is there a problem in being an Outsider, First Citizen?}
{171}{}{I am the descendant of the Vault Dweller. The GECK is needed to help my village.}
{172}{}{I am the descendant of the Vault Dweller, First Citizen. The GECK is required to help my village.}
{173}{}{Woman, give me the GECK now, or I shall take it by force.}
{174}{}{Give me the GECK now, or I shall take it by force.}
{175}{}{Then we have nothing more to discuss. Good day.}
{176}{lyn013}{The problem IS that all Outsiders wish to join our society, which is simply not feasible.
 We would undoubtedly sink into the same anarchy which plagues the outside.}
{177}{}{I see. I wish to speak to the Overseer of the Vault. Can you take me to him?}
{178}{}{How does one go about becoming one of you Vault Dwellers?}
{179}{}{If you hate the outside world so much, why do you live outside, and not in the vault?}
{180}{}{Já ouvi o suficiente. Tchau.}
{181}{}{I... understand. Thank you for your time, First Citizen.}
{182}{lyn014}{I find ALL of you Outsiders offensive. You are uncultured and primitive, no better than
 animals! Now leave. Or I shall have you forcibly removed.}
{183}{}{No! I'm not leaving until I get some answers!}
{184}{}{"Forcibly removed?" TRY it. I'll like it.}
{185}{}{Eu irei em silêncio... desta vez.}
{186}{}{I'm leaving, I'm leaving.}
{187}{lyn015a}{"Overseer?" Why, no. There has been no Overseer in a hundred years. How do you know of
 the Vault Overseers?}
{188}{lyn015b}{I have told you already. Overseers are from the distant past.}
{189}{}{I am a descendant of the first Vault Dweller. I have heard... many stories of the Overseer.}
{190}{}{What happened to the Overseer? I must speak with him.}
{191}{}{You are OBVIOUSLY not the one I need to be speaking to. Fetch the Overseer at once, woman.}
{192}{}{You are OBVIOUSLY not the one I need to be speaking to. Fetch the Overseer at once.}
{193}{}{Never mind. I must be going. Good day.}
{194}{lyn016}{"Descendant of the Vault Dweller?" What do you mean?}
{195}{}{I am the great grandchild of the first Vault Dweller.}
{196}{}{Woman, I'm wasting precious time talking with you. Fetch the Overseer at once.}
{197}{}{I'm wasting precious time talking with you. Fetch the Overseer at once.}
{198}{}{Nothing, never mind. We'll continue this conversation later.}
{199}{lyn017a}{You barge into my chambers and then have the audacity to insult me, Lynette, First Citizen of Vault City?!}
{200}{lyn017b}{You barge into my chambers and then have the audacity to make demands of me, Lynette, First Citizen of Vault City?!}
{201}{lyn017c}{Leave. You are no longer welcome in this city.}
{202}{}{I'm NOT leaving until I get some answers.}
{203}{}{I'll go... for now.}
{204}{lyn018}{No, no, we do not live in the vault. They were a temporary measure to protect a chosen
 few from the war and aid them in the subsequent construction of a new world.}
{205}{}{How did you know when to leave the vault? I heard the vaults were isolated from the outside world.}
{206}{}{It is important that I speak with the Overseer. Can you take me to him?}
{207}{}{I'm wasting precious time talking with you. Fetch the Overseer at once, woman.}
{208}{}{I'm wasting precious time talking with you. Fetch the Overseer at once.}
{209}{}{Já ouvi o suficiente. Tchau.}
{210}{}{Thank you for your time, First Citizen. Good day.}
{211}{lyn019}{There is no "Overseer." When we came to the surface, we formed a new government. The Overseer position was superfluous.}
{212}{}{New government? Tell me about it.}
{213}{}{So you're the leader of the former vault dwellers?}
{214}{}{Smart. Get rid of the corrupt Overseer.}
{215}{}{I see. Thanks for the information. Good day.}
{216}{lyn020}{What you heard was incorrect. Our archives are quite clear: our vault received the all-clear signal two years after being sealed.}
{217}{}{The "all-clear" signal? From where?}
{218}{}{Where are these archives?}
{219}{}{Where is the Overseer? I must speak with him.}
{220}{}{Well, OUR tribal legend states the Vault was closed for years... and no "all-clear" signal ever came.}
{221}{}{You lie! The all-clear never came!}
{222}{}{I see. Thanks for the information. Good day.}
{223}{lyn021}{Why... from surface monitors, I suppose. I am certain there were sensors monitoring
 the environment. How else would the Overseer have known when it was safe to leave?}
{224}{}{Do these monitors still exist? Can I see them?}
{225}{}{So... the order to leave the vault came from the Overseer?}
{226}{}{Speaking of the Overseer, where is he? I'd like to speak to him.}
{227}{}{You lie! The all-clear signal never came!}
{228}{}{I'm not certain... yet. Good day.}
{229}{lyn022}{Quite likely they were disassembled and used as upgrades for other systems.}
{230}{}{Hmmm. But the Overseer was the one who gave the order to leave the vault?}
{231}{}{Where is the Overseer? I must speak with him about this.}
{232}{}{I don't believe you. I'm telling you, the all-clear signal never came!}
{233}{}{I see. Thanks for the information. Good day.}
{234}{lyn023}{Yes... at least, that's what I remember from the archives. However, I am certain many
 Citizens were responsible for monitoring the surface sensors.}
{235}{}{Any idea where these surface sensors are now?}
{236}{}{Where are these archives?}
{237}{}{Where is the Overseer? I must speak with him.}
{238}{}{You lie! The all-clear signal never came!}
{239}{}{I see. Thanks for the information. Good day.}
{240}{lyn024}{If you were capable of examining your argument, the flaw would quickly become apparent.
 The archives do not allow for the same form of corruption your... "tribal legends" do.}
{241}{}{Where are these archives?}
{242}{}{Where is the Overseer? I must speak with him.}
{243}{}{Look, I'm telling you... the all-clear signal never came!}
{244}{}{I've heard enough. Good day.}
{245}{lyn025}{You have the audacity to accuse me, Lynette, the First Citizen of Vault City, of LYING?!
 Leave! You are no longer welcome in this city.}
{246}{}{I'm not leaving until I get some answers!}
{247}{}{I shall leave... for now.}
{248}{lyn026}{The archives are stored within our vault. Only Citizens have access to them... they are
 NOT for Outsiders.}
{249}{}{Fine. Where is the Overseer? I will ask him about these archives.}
{250}{}{But I am a Citizen.}
{251}{}{How does one become one of you Vault Dwellers?}
{252}{}{How can I become a Citizen?}
{253}{}{I've heard enough. Good day.}
{254}{lyn027}{We no longer consider ourselves to be "Vault Dwellers"... we refer to ourselves as
 "Citizens." If you wish to become part of our community, you must first prove your worth.}
{255}{}{Prove my worth? How?}
{256}{}{I am the descendant of the first Vault Dweller -- that should be enough.}
{257}{}{I'll think about it. Good day.}
{258}{lyn028}{You misunderstand... it is not the world we object to, it is the people in it. Look
 around -- within these walls is all that remains of pre-war civilization.}
{259}{}{Where is the Overseer? I need to speak with him.}
{260}{}{It isn't right you don't share. It's your responsibility to help everyone... not just those
 that live in these walls.}
{261}{}{Eu... vejo. Obrigado por enquanto. Bom dia.}
{262}{lyn029}{You Outsiders are fine ones to lecture about "responsibility." You beg incessantly for
 help, yet do nothing to better yourselves. Our talk is over... leave now, before I summon the guards.}
{263}{}{You better summon the guards now, because you're not going to have another chance.}
{264}{}{I'm not leaving until I see the Overseer!}
{265}{}{I'm leaving... for now.}
{266}{}{Very well. Thank you for speaking with me. Good day.}
{267}{lyn030}{"The first Vault Dweller?" What? You must mean another Vault! We have never been in
 contact with another Vault! Where is it located?}
{268}{}{I think THIS was the vault my ancestor originally came from.}
{269}{}{I don't live in a Vault. I come from a tribal village from the west.}
{270}{}{I don't know... you see, I'm trying to find the Vault my ancestor came from.}
{271}{}{When I find it, I'll be sure to let you know. Good day.}
{272}{lyn031}{We exited the Vault 120 years ago and, with the help of our Eden kit, began construction
 of Vault City. Ten years later, the Overseer retired and a Council of Citizens was established. The
 Council appointed the initial First Citizen.}
{273}{}{Falando em GECK, você tem outro que poderia me dar?}
{274}{}{Então você é o líder desta cidade?}
{275}{}{120 anos atrás? Isso foi 70 anos antes do Morador da Vault parar o Mestre. Essa não pode ser a vault
 que estou procurando.}
{276}{}{Estou vendo. Bom dia.}
{277}{lyn032}{Correto... Eu sou o Primeira Cidadã de Vault City.}
{278}{}{First Citizen, I have an urgent request: My village is in dire need of a Garden of Eden Creation
 Kit. Do you possess one that I may have?}
{279}{}{Then you are who I seek. I have come on behalf of the people of Arroyo to claim what is
 rightfully ours: the holy GECK.}
{280}{}{I see. Thanks for speaking with me. Good day.}
{281}{lyn033}{Corrupt?! The Overseer was a great man and a flawless leader. His teachings and wisdom
 still comprise much of our schooling.}
{282}{}{This doesn't sound like Overseer the Vault Dweller knew.}
{283}{}{After saving the Vault, the Vault Dweller was banished by the Overseer. What kind of lesson is that?}
{284}{}{Then you have been raised a fool. Waste no more of my time, woman. Fetch someone who can help me.}
{285}{}{Then you have been raised a fool. Waste no more of my time. Fetch someone who can help me.}
{286}{}{That is unfortunate. Good day.}
{287}{lyn034a}{You may speak with Proconsul Gregory. He has authority to administer the Citizenship
 test. He can be found in the meeting room down the corridor.}
{288}{lyn034b}{Ou... existe OUTRA forma de se tornar um Cidadão...}
{289}{}{Outra forma? Como?}
{290}{}{Acho que vou falar com o Proconsul. Adeus.}
{291}{}{Vou falar com o Proconsul então.}
{292}{}{Vou falar com Gregory. Obrigado pelo seu tempo, Primeira Cidadã.}
{293}{lyn035}{Completamente impossível. No século em que vivemos fora da Vault, ninguém jamais
 escolheu sair. Embora houvesse dois Cidadãos exilados de nossa cidade há muito tempo... como punição por seus crimes.}
{294}{}{Vocês são aqueles que expulsaram o Morador da Vault! Eu vim pelo que é meu por direito!}
{295}{}{O que esses cidadãos fizeram?}
{296}{}{Se este não é a Vault certo, devo encontrar aquele de onde meu ancestral veio.}
{297}{}{Eu tenho que ir. Bom dia.}
{298}{lyn036a}{Vila? Mas você está vestindo um traje da Vault... o que é essa vila de que você fala? Fale
 claramente: minha paciência está se esgotando.}
{299}{lyn036b}{Vila? Primeiro você me diz que é de uma vault, agora de uma vila. O que é isso?!
 Minha paciência para sua conversa dupla está se esgotando.}
{300}{}{Espere, você me entendeu mal. O Morador da Vault foi o fundador da minha vila.}
{301}{}{Minha paciência com VOCÊ está se esgotando, mulher. Chame outra pessoa... alguém que possa me ajudar.}
{302}{}{Minha paciência com VOCÊ está se esgotando. Chame outra pessoa... alguém que possa me ajudar.}
{303}{}{Acho que vou voltar mais tarde. Bom dia.}
{304}{lyn037}{Ah agora eu entendo. Mas que prova você tem de que seu ancestral veio de uma Vault?}
{305}{}{Histórias, transmitidas pela Anciã da minha Aldeia.}
{306}{}{Eu tenho os artefatos sagrados do Morador da Vault... esta roupa da Vault, e este frasco sagrado.}
{307}{}{Eu tenho esse uniforme da Vault e esse cantil. Eles pertenciam ao meu ancestral.}
{308}{}{Estou cansado de suas perguntas. Vou procurar outra pessoa que possa me ajudar.}
{309}{}{Eu tenho que ir. Bom dia.}
{310}{lyn038}{Hmm... talvez alguma menção a sua Vault esteja em nossos arquivos de computador.}
{311}{}{Bem, podemos verificar?}
{312}{}{Primeira Cidadã, é muito importante para mim descobrir a localização da Vault do meu
 ancestral. Se eu pudesse verificar os arquivos, ficaria grato.}
{313}{}{Hmmmm. Obrigado pela informação. Bom dia.}
{314}{lyn039}{Desculpe, mas usamos o nosso para começar Vault City. Não acredito que tenha
 sobressalente, mas você pode verificar no Escritório de Aquisições. Ele está localizado na entrada do nosso cofre.}
{315}{}{Obrigado. Eu tenho algumas outras questões...}
{316}{}{Você sabe onde fica a Vault 13?}
{317}{}{Ótimo! Eu vou lá então. Bom dia.}
{318}{lyn040}{Um macacão sujo e um cantil surrado? Essa é a sua prova? Quem sabe de onde você
 tirou essas "relíquias"... ou quem você matou para roubá-las.}
{319}{}{Por favor... olhe para eles novamente. Eles são genuínos.}
{320}{}{Eu viajei por todo esse caminho. Pelo menos OLHE para eles, mulher!}
{321}{}{Eu viajei por todo esse caminho. Pelo menos OLHE para eles!}
{322}{}{Se eles não são suficientes para te convencer, então não há mais nada a ser dito. Bom dia.}
{323}{lyn041a}{Você tem alguma ideia de como estou ocupada? Eu administro esta cidade e tenho pouco
 tempo para perder com você e suas reivindicações selvagens.}
{324}{lyn041b}{Você tem alguma ideia de como estou ocupada? Eu administro esta cidade e tenho
 pouco tempo para perder com você.}
{325}{lyn041c}{Agora saia imediatamente, ou chamarei os guardas.}
{326}{}{Vá em frente e ligue para eles. Eles não chegarão aqui a tempo de salvar sua vida.}
{327}{}{Bem. Estou indo embora.}
{328}{}{Muito bem, Primeira Cidadã. Bom dia.}
{329}{lyn042}{Uma lenda tribal? Você precisará de algo mais substancial do que algum... MITO tribal
 se quiser que alguém acredite em sua afirmação.}
{330}{}{Mas eu tenho os artefatos sagrados do Morador da Vault... este uniforme da Vault, e este frasco sagrado.}
{331}{}{Eu tenho esse uniforme da Vault e esse cantil. Eles pertenciam ao meu ancestral.}
{332}{}{O que devo fazer para provar minha herança, se você não acredita em minha palavra?!}
{333}{}{Bem. Estou indo embora.}
{334}{}{Muito bem, então não temos mais nada a discutir. Bom dia, Primeira Cidadã.}
{335}{lyn043}{Poderíamos verificar os computadores da Vault. Eles provavelmente teriam as informações
 que você procura. Mas apenas os cidadãos têm permissão para acessar os arquivos.}
{336}{}{But I am a Citizen.}
{337}{}{Existe alguma maneira de eu me tornar um Cidadão?}
{338}{}{Acho que estou sem sorte, então. Bom dia.}
{339}{lyn044}{Em vez de fazer o teste, você pode provar seu compromisso com as Vaults de uma forma
 mais... substancial. Como um estranho, você está em uma posição única para resolver uma situação difícil para nós.}
{340}{}{Que tipo de situação?}
{341}{}{Claro. O que quer que as vaults precisem, é meu dever entregar.}
{342}{}{Não sei... o teste de Cidadania não é procedimento padrão?}
{343}{}{Acho que não sou a pessoa certa para o trabalho... adeus.}
{344}{}{Não, obrigado, eu realmente deveria ir. Bom dia, Primeira Cidadã.}
{345}{lyn045}{Murderers, both of them. Boyarsky was exiled ten years ago, and Richard Moreau was exiled
 shortly after we left the Vault. Citizenship is a sacred trust -- crime is not tolerated within our walls.}
{346}{}{Se este não é a Vault certo, devo encontrar aquele de onde meu ancestral veio.}
{347}{}{How does a person become a Citizen?}
{348}{}{I've heard enough. I have to be going.}
{349}{}{I see. Well, thanks for your time, First Citizen. Good day.}
{350}{lyn046}{What are you talking about? You must be mistaken. Whatever... "Vault Dweller" YOU'RE
 speaking of must be from some other Vault.}
{351}{}{If that is true, then I need to find this other Vault.}
{352}{}{You lie! THIS is the Vault my ancestor is from!}
{353}{}{Perhaps so. Thanks for speaking with me. Goodbye.}
{354}{lyn047}{There's a town... if you could call it that... to the northeast of our city. It is filled
 with... creatures that are polluting the groundwater with dangerous radiation.}
{355}{}{How are they poisoning the groundwater?}
{356}{}{What do you want me to do about it?}
{357}{}{On second thought, this doesn't sound like something I'd be interested in. Goodbye.}
{358}{lyn048}{Disable their plant, permanently, so that they cannot cause any more damage.}
{359}{}{Sounds easy enough. I'll be back when the situation's... "resolved."}
{360}{}{How exactly is this plant releasing radiation?}
{361}{}{Let me think about it. I'll get back to you.}
{362}{lyn049}{Those... things... are operating a damaged atomic power plant. You see, THEY are
 immune to radiation... they don't care that they are slowly killing us with their poisons.}
{363}{}{I'll take care of the problem. I'll be back when the situation's... "resolved."}
{364}{}{Sounds like they're doing the world a service. Find some other "Outsider" to do your dirty work.}
{365}{}{I'll have to think about it. I'll get back to you.}
{366}{lyn050}{Very well, let me see... These... these are authentic! Unbelievable... you ARE a
 survivor from another vault! Welcome to our City... you must have suffered much in the outside world.}
{367}{}{I need to find the Vault my people came from.}
{368}{}{I need a Garden of Eden Kit. Do you have one?}
{369}{}{Oh, so now I'm welcome in your city? Forget this... I'm outta here.}
{370}{}{You have no idea... but I'll tell you about the Temple of Trials some other time. Goodbye.}
{371}{lyn051}{I'm giving you an opportunity few Outsiders ever receive. You may take the test, if you
 wish. But resolving this situation for us may prove more rewarding. Do you understand me?}
{372}{}{All right then. What kind of situation?}
{373}{}{I understand. Whatever the vaults need, it is my duty to deliver.}
{374}{}{Acho que não sou a pessoa certa para o trabalho... adeus.}
{375}{}{I think I really should be going. Good day, First Citizen.}
{376}{lyn052}{Oh... that's right. The Proconsul mentioned we had gained a new Citizen. Welcome,
 Citizen. As for the archives, yes... they are located inside our Vault. Peruse them at your leisure.}
{377}{}{Before I go examine the archives, I wanted to ask you some other questions...}
{378}{}{Do you happen to have a GECK as well?}
{379}{}{Grande! Obrigado.}
{380}{}{Thank you, First Citizen.}
{381}{lyn053a}{Yes? What is it I can help you with?}
{382}{lyn053b}{Yes? What is it?}
{383}{}{Hunh?}
{384}{}{Valt! Valt!}
{385}{}{Funnneee eyes!}
{386}{}{Tchauzinho}
{387}{}{I had some questions I wanted to ask you.}
{388}{}{I had some questions I wanted to ask you.}
{389}{}{How does one become a Citizen of Vault City?}
{390}{}{I have reconsidered your offer for Citizenship.}
{391}{}{About the Gecko power plant...}
{392}{}{I have some information on those raiders who've been attacking the city.}
{393}{}{I found out some more information on those raiders who were attacking the city.}
{394}{}{I found something in Bishop's safe you might be interested in.}
{395}{}{I believe Dr. Troy is involved in something illegal.}
{396}{}{I must speak with you on the delivery of that holodisk.}
{397}{}{I've changed my mind. I will deliver that holodisk to the Counselor in the NCR.}
{398}{}{Nada. Me desculpe por perturbar você.}
{399}{lyn054a}{Of course. What can I help you with, Citizen?}
{400}{lyn054b}{Of course. What can I help you with, Captain?}
{401}{}{O que você pode me dizer sobre esses ataques de saqueados em nossa cidade?}
{402}{}{Encontrei um Cidadão no centro da cidade, Thomas Moore. Quem é ele?}
{403}{}{Você tem um GECK?}
{404}{}{I'm looking for Vault 13.}
{405}{}{Aqui é Vault City? Por que você não mora em uma vault?}
{406}{}{Por que você tolera a escravidão?}
{407}{}{Nada por hoje, valeu.}
{408}{lyn055}{Para um não cidadão, você certamente exige muito do meu tempo.}
{409}{}{Mas EU SOU um Cidadão.}
{410}{}{Você tem um GECK?}
{411}{}{I'm looking for Vault 13.}
{412}{}{O que preciso fazer para me tornar um Cidadão?}
{413}{}{Aqui é Vault City? Por que você não mora em uma vault?}
{414}{}{Por que você tolera a escravidão?}
{415}{}{Deixa pra lá então. Bom dia.}
{416}{lyn056}{O que é?! Não tenho tempo para suas bobagens!}
{417}{}{Gostaria de te fazer outra pergunta.}
{418}{}{Peço desculpas por meus comentários anteriores, Primeira
 Cidadã. Eu esperava poder fazer algumas perguntas sobre Vault City.}
{419}{}{Você sabe, existem marcas descafeinadas que têm um sabor tão bom quanto o real.}
{420}{}{Deixa pra lá.}
{421}{}{Minhas desculpas, Primeira Cidadã. Lamento perturbá-la.}
{422}{lyn057}{O que é? Você já não cuidou deles?}
{423}{}{É um pouco mais complicado do que isso. Entenda, esses caras não eram qualquer bando de
 invasores... eles eram mercenários.}
{424}{}{Deixa pra lá. Adeus.}
{425}{lyn058}{Não me lembro do seu recrutamento. Me deixe ver seus documentos.}
{426}{}{Aqui você os tem. Tudo deve estar em ordem.}
{427}{}{Umm... Eu não tenho meus papéis comigo.}
{428}{}{Meus papéis? Eles ainda não foram processados. Eles devem aparecer em sua mesa a qualquer momento.}
{429}{}{Meus papéis? Eles ainda não foram processados. Eles devem aparecer em sua mesa a qualquer momento.}
{430}{lyn059}{Não brinque comigo, "Cidadão", ou vou garantir que você nunca mais ande pelas ruas de Vault City. Agora saia.}
{431}{}{Sem problemas... Já estou indo. Adeus.}
{432}{}{Bom dia, Primeira Cidadã.}
{433}{lyn060}{Você acha que sou ESTUPIDA? Se alguém sabe o que são falsificações, sou eu! Quem te deu
 esses papéis?! Se você me disser, permitirei que você mantenha seu passe diário.}
{434}{}{Era um Cidadão chamado Skeev no portão da frente.}
{435}{}{Eu, uh, não me lembro.}
{436}{}{Você vai ter que me pegar primeiro.}
{437}{lyn061}{Hummm... muito bem. Mas não apareça novamente até que você tenha seus documentos de cidadania. Bom dia.}
{438}{}{Adeus.}
{439}{}{Bom dia, Primeira Cidadã.}
{440}{lyn062}{Oh sério? Isso confirma minhas suspeitas. Seu acesso à Vault City foi revogado, entregue
 seu passe diário e vá com meus guardas até o portão da frente.}
{441}{}{What? You said you'd let me keep my Day Pass!}
{442}{}{I'm not going anywhere. You want this Day Pass, you come GET it.}
{443}{}{All right, I'm going. I don't want any trouble.}
{444}{lyn063}{You have? So you will stop Gecko from contaminating our water? By ANY means necessary?}
{445}{}{Yes, I will -- in exchange for Citizenship and access to your Vault computers.}
{446}{}{No, not really. I was just checking if the offer was still open.}
{447}{lyn064}{Very well then. Report back to me when the job is finished, and I will grant you Citizenship.}
{448}{}{Posso te fazer outra pergunta antes de ir?}
{449}{}{All right. I'll return when the situation's been taken care of.}
{450}{lyn065}{Have you resolved the situation?}
{451}{}{I found out all they need to get their plant running clean is a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator.}
{452}{}{The power plant's been destroyed. If I were you, I'd make sure your brahmin graze to the southwest from now on.}
{453}{}{I took care of Gecko's power plant. You shouldn't have any more trouble with it leaking radiation.}
{454}{}{No, not yet. I'm still working on it.}
{455}{lyn066}{Then do not waste my time. Return when you have something to report.}
{456}{}{All right. I'll be back later.}
{457}{}{Very well. Good day, First Citizen.}
{458}{lyn067a}{So you HAVEN'T taken care of the problem?}
{459}{lyn067b}{If you still want Citizenship, you had better handle it.}
{460}{}{As I understand it, you have the part here in Vault City to fix their plant.}
{461}{}{All right. I'll be back later.}
{462}{}{Very well. Good day, First Citizen.}
{463}{lyn068}{What if we do? That is only a temporary solution. Please FIX the problem, NOT their power
 plant. Am I making myself clear?}
{464}{}{First Citizen, I mean no disrespect, but there's a way to solve your problem without killing the ghouls
 or shutting down their reactor. Now, if I could just get the part...?}
{465}{}{You said you wanted me to fix the plant, not massacre Gecko.}
{466}{}{Crystal. I'll be back later.}
{467}{}{Yes. Good day, First Citizen.}
{468}{lyn069a}{What is this... creature... you have with you?! Such... things are not permitted inside
 Vault City! Guards! Escort these intruders to the front gate at once!}
{469}{lyn069b}{Oh, did I? I seem to recall you claiming that you were a Citizen. You are no longer
 permitted inside Vault City. My guards will escort you to the front gate.}
{470}{lyn069c}{I've had enough of your foolishness! You are no longer permitted inside Vault City. My
 guards will escort you to the front gate.}
{471}{}{Die glazzeeeye!}
{472}{}{hã-ham.}
{473}{}{You don't like my friend, huh? That's too bad. Cause he likes you... for DINNER.}
{474}{}{Your guards won't get here in time to save your life... "First Citizen."}
{475}{}{No need for the guards -- I'll leave peacefully.}
{476}{lyn070}{What? You destroyed the plant?! The contamination! You IDIOT. At least those ghouls are
 gone... Get out of my sight.}
{477}{}{Whoa! What about that Citizenship you promised?}
{478}{}{Look, causing that much destruction wasn't easy! I expect SOME compensation...}
{479}{}{All right, all right. I'm leaving.}
{480}{}{Good-day, First Citizen.}
{481}{lyn071}{Do not toy with me, or I will make certain you never walk Vault City's streets again.}
{482}{}{You watch yourself, "First Citizen." Goodbye.}
{483}{}{Bom dia, Primeira Cidadã.}
{484}{lyn072a}{You did it! Excellent! You have performed a valuable service for Vault City. Please
 accept this as a token of our appreciation. To think a band of RAIDERS was causing so much trouble...}
{485}{lyn072b}{Excellent. No more than they deserved. To think a band of RAIDERS was causing so much trouble...}
{486}{}{Well, they weren't really a roving band of raiders... turns out they were mercenaries.}
{487}{lyn073}{So you disabled their plant?}
{488}{}{No, I repaired it. Councilor McClure gave me the part I needed and that was enough to get the plant running properly.}
{489}{}{It's all taken care of.}
{490}{lyn074}{What?! He did?! I suppose he granted you Citizenship, also! Fixing Gecko's plant won't
 solve anything. Those... creatures! They cannot be trusted! What happens when their plant starts leaking again?!}
{491}{}{I don't know... maybe HELP them fix it?}
{492}{}{Look, the groundwater isn't being contaminated anymore, and no one got hurt. The problem's solved.}
{493}{}{I'll come back later when you've calmed down.}
{494}{}{I have to leave, First Citizen. Good day.}
{495}{lyn075}{You had better watch your step in this city, "Citizen." I'll be watching you. One misstep, and you'll be exiled.}
{496}{}{That does it. Nobody threatens me, especially some bigoted bitch with a stick up her butt. Time to die.}
{497}{}{Mess with me, Lynette, and Vault City will need a new First Citizen. Understand?}
{498}{}{So? I'll just get McClure to get my Citizenship back. He seems like real First Citizen material.}
{499}{}{I'll come back later when you've calmed down.}
{500}{}{Bom dia, Primeira Cidadã.}
{501}{lyn076a}{Excellent. You have conducted yourself as a true Vault Citizen.}
{502}{lyn076b}{It is my pleasure to grant you Citizenship, complete with privileges and access to our facilities.}
{503}{}{Hey, I was hoping to get some monetary compensation.}
{504}{}{No problem. Just doing my job. Goodbye.}
{505}{}{It was my pleasure, First Citizen. Good day.}
{506}{}{Great, thanks. I'll go check them out now.}
{507}{}{I appreciate all you've done for me, First Citizen. Good day.}
{508}{lyn077ab}{You have already received much, Outsider. Citizenship is its own reward.}
{509}{lyn077b}{Citizenship is its own reward.}
{510}{}{Like hell! Some money better change hands right now, or Vault City's going to need a new First Citizen.}
{511}{}{No problem... I was just curious. Goodbye.}
{512}{}{Muito bem, Primeira Cidadã. Bom dia.}
{513}{lyn077_a}{Absolutely not.}
{514}{}{I wonder who'll take over after you're dead... in about a minute from now.}
{515}{}{No problem... Thought I'd give it a try. Goodbye.}
{516}{lyn078}{Dr. Troy?! What makes you say that?}
{517}{}{He asked me to smuggle in some illegal drugs into the city.}
{518}{}{He only administers healing to Citizens.}
{519}{}{Nothing... I misspoke. Good day.}
{520}{lyn079}{Who are you to be accusing a Citizen of such crimes? Guards! Escort this Outsider to the gates!}
{521}{}{Your guards won't get here in time to save your life... "First Citizen."}
{522}{}{No need for the guards -- I'll leave peacefully.}
{523}{}{But it's the truth! You have to believe me! I have pr --!}
{524}{lyn080}{That is a very serious accusation. Since you are a Citizen, I must take you at your word...
 but are you absolutely certain? If true, his Citizenship would be revoked, and he would be exiled.}
{525}{}{Look, I know it's hard for you to believe, but he asked me to smuggle Jet into Vault City for him.}
{526}{}{Isn't that a little harsh? Couldn't you just rehabilitate him and keep him on as a doctor?}
{527}{}{Oh. Uh... I misspoke. I meant to say Dr. Troy is involved in PARALEGAL activities, not illegal ones.}
{528}{}{Hmmmm. I'll go see if I can find anything else out.}
{529}{lyn081}{I can't believe a Citizen of such stature would become addicted to drugs. Thank you for your
 honesty, Citizen. I will take care of this immediately.}
{530}{}{Eu tenho mais algumas perguntas...}
{531}{}{Great. The entire situation had me concerned. Goodbye.}
{532}{}{Thank you, First Citizen. I only wanted to see justice carried out.}
{533}{lyn082a}{Inform me at once if you discover anything more.}
{534}{lyn082b}{Vault City prevails, Citizen.}
{535}{}{Eu tenho mais algumas perguntas...}
{536}{}{Sure. Goodbye.}
{537}{}{I will. Thank you, First Citizen.}
{538}{lyn083}{The law is the law. Exceptions make us no better than the Outsiders. Again, are you
 absolutely certain of your accusations?}
{539}{}{So bribing me to solve your Gecko situation with Citizenship papers... that's legal?}
{540}{}{Yes. He asked me to smuggle Jet into Vault City for him.}
{541}{}{Oh. Uh... I misspoke. I meant to say Dr. Troy is involved in PARALEGAL activities, not illegal ones.}
{542}{}{Hmmmm. I'll go see if I can find anything else out.}
{543}{lyn084a}{You had best watch what you say.}
{544}{lyn084b}{You had best watch what you say, Outsider.}
{545}{lyn084c}{If I hear of you making trouble for Dr. Troy, or any other Citizen, you will never walk
 the streets of Vault City again. Understood?}
{546}{}{Uh... claro. Desculpa. Eu tenho algumas perguntas...}
{547}{}{Crystal clear. I'll just be going now.}
{548}{}{My apologies, First Citizen. Good day.}
{549}{lyn085}{Of COURSE he only treats Citizens. He has no time to treat Outsiders... we have an Auto-Doc
 in the courtyard for that.}
{550}{}{Well, you might want to know that the Doctor asked me to smuggle some illegal drugs into the city.}
{551}{}{Oh. Look, I had some other questions...}
{552}{}{Yeah, for those that can pay... and that's assuming they come out of the Auto-Doc in one piece.}
{553}{}{All right, never mind then. Goodbye.}
{554}{}{My apologies, First Citizen. Good day.}
{555}{lyn086}{I believe it is time you left. I suggest you make your stay in Vault City a short one.}
{556}{}{Before I go, I had some more questions...}
{557}{}{Tudo bem. Estou saindo.}
{558}{lyn087}{Moore? He's a troublemaker. THAT'S what he is.}
{559}{}{You're right. He's got... outside interests.}
{560}{}{Why do you say he's a troublemaker?}
{561}{}{Posso te fazer outra pergunta?}
{562}{}{I spoke with him... and a lot of what he says makes sense.}
{563}{}{Concordo. Você quer que eu... cuide dele?}
{564}{}{You should revoke his Citizenship, then.}
{565}{}{I see. I'll be sure to stay clear of him then. Good day.}
{566}{lyn088}{He constantly seeks to convince the Citizens to turn Vault City into a..."democracy,"
 as he calls it, with everyone having a say in laws and decision-making. *I* call it mob rule.}
{567}{}{"Democracy?"}
{568}{}{How does he try and convince the Citizens?}
{569}{}{He sounds like a problem. How about I... take care of him?}
{570}{}{Can't you just kick him out?}
{571}{}{Eu tenho mais algumas perguntas...}
{572}{}{Oh. Well, thanks for the information. Good day.}
{573}{lyn089}{The archives state that many old world nations had such a government. We know where THAT
 got them. Can you imagine how long it would take to get anything done in such a society? It's inconceivable.}
{574}{}{Inconceivable? Why?}
{575}{}{How does Moore try and convince the Citizens?}
{576}{}{Eu tenho mais algumas perguntas...}
{577}{}{I suppose so. I have to be going.}
{578}{}{Thanks for your time, First Citizen. Good day.}
{579}{lyn090}{A government needs a strong, capable leader who can make decisions quickly and has the
 power to enforce them. Government by committee is no kind of government at all.}
{580}{}{How does Moore try and convince the Citizens that Vault City should be a democracy?}
{581}{}{Eu tenho mais algumas perguntas...}
{582}{}{I suppose so. I have to be going.}
{583}{}{Thanks for your time, First Citizen. Good day.}
{584}{lyn091}{Mostly by ranting in public and making a fool of himself. He plays on our sympathies with
 tales of a plague in the NCR, as if WE could take care of the whole world.}
{585}{}{Sounds like a real problem. Do you want me to... take care of him?}
{586}{}{You know he's right: you probably could. Your medical technology IS pretty impressive.}
{587}{}{Can't you just kick him out?}
{588}{}{Oh. Well, I was just curious about him. Good day.}
{589}{lyn092}{You, too? A Citizen is free to his own beliefs, but this... THIS! Perhaps you are incapable
 of handling the responsibility of Citizenship!}
{590}{}{Whoa... sorry! Look, never mind... I had some other questions I wanted to ask you...}
{591}{}{If it means agreeing blindly with you, then maybe YOU'RE the one incapable of handling the responsibility of Citizenship.}
{592}{}{Thomas Moore is a Citizen, and he is the leader of this movement.}
{593}{}{This is a new era, it is time for change.}
{594}{}{I'm sorry you feel this way. Bye.}
{595}{lyn093}{No. He is not a TRUE Citizen... not anymore. When he came to us two years ago, he seemed
 everything we would want in a Citizen. But just a year later he... changed. He turned against us.}
{596}{}{You know, that would explain a few things. Moore was probably just playing a role for a while.}
{597}{}{Maybe it's time for a change.}
{598}{}{I'm sorry you don't consider Moore a "true" Citizen. Maybe you should examine what it means to
 be a Citizen.}
{599}{}{Maybe he just saw the light. Good day.}
{600}{lyn094}{We have prospered in this world where so many others have failed, and you tell me we need
 to change? Look at the outside world! Anarchy, depravity, sickness... Vault City is a paradise!}
{601}{}{That's exactly WHY a change is necessary. You should share your accomplishments with others.}
{602}{}{It's a paradise for some people, maybe. I think your slaves would disagree.}
{603}{}{I'm not going to argue this with you anymore. Goodbye.}
{604}{lyn095}{Vault City was built through the hard work and suffering of many Citizens. The outside
 world should look to our example and follow it, not sit outside our walls and beg for handouts.}
{605}{}{The hard work of Citizens? Everywhere I go in your city, I see the real work being done by slaves.}
{606}{}{I'm not going to argue this with you anymore. Goodbye.}
{607}{lyn096}{Why do we condone slavery? The system has been in place for many years, and it works
 quite well. Both parties benefit from the institution.}
{608}{}{I see. Can I ask you another question?}
{609}{}{I'm sure your slaves would disagree.}
{610}{}{But... you buy and sell human beings like brahmin. Doesn't keeping slaves bother you?}
{611}{}{Já ouvi o suficiente. Tchau.}
{612}{}{Thanks for your time, First Citizen. Good day.}
{613}{lyn097}{They are not slaves, they are our "servants." We have given them homes, food, clothing,
 and a purpose. We have given them a life.}
{614}{}{Sure. Why be free when they could be laboring for you?}
{615}{}{Look, no matter what sweet-sounding words you use to cover the stink, it's still slavery.}
{616}{}{Uh... sure. Look, I had some other questions...}
{617}{}{I'm not going to argue this with you anymore. Goodbye.}
{618}{}{Hmmmm. I hadn't considered it that way before. I'll have to go think about this.}
{619}{lyn098}{Your hypocrisy is quite remarkable. You have the mark of the Slaver's Guild, yet you disagree with slavery.}
{620}{}{I don't disagree with slavery, I'm just pointing out they do all the real work around here.}
{621}{}{Look, I got the mark only to get some information... I'm no slaver.}
{622}{}{I was young... I needed the money...}
{623}{}{I'm not going to argue this with you anymore. Goodbye.}
{624}{lyn099}{What do you mean?}
{625}{}{Moore's actually working for the New California Republic.}
{626}{}{Sem problemas. Eu tenho outras perguntas...}
{627}{}{Nothing. I have to be going. Goodbye.}
{628}{}{Nothing. I misspoke. Good day, First Citizen.}
{629}{lyn100}{Kill him?! Murder is not in any way, shape, or form permitted in Vault City -- even if for the best. Never speak of this again.}
{630}{}{Entendido. Posso fazer mais algumas perguntas?}
{631}{}{Look, 'murder' is such an ugly word. I could arrange some sort of accident. . . a drug overdose,
 mauled by a brahmin... any of a number of things can happen in this dangerous world.}
{632}{}{Tudo bem. Estou saindo.}
{633}{}{Muito bem, Primeira Cidadã. Bom dia.}
{634}{lyn101}{This is not conduct of a Citizen! I am revoking your Citizenship. My guards will show you to the front gate.}
{635}{}{Your guards won't get here in time to save your life... "First Citizen."}
{636}{}{No need for the guards. I'll leave peacefully.}
{637}{lyn102}{Although it would serve Vault City's interests, I can't... as long as he breaks no laws,
 Moore is permitted to say anything he wants.}
{638}{}{Do you want me to... take care of him?}
{639}{}{Oh, but he has. You see, Moore isn't just a Citizen... he's been looking out for someone else's interests.}
{640}{}{Posso te fazer outra pergunta?}
{641}{}{Well, he'll probably bury himself at the rate he's going. Talk to you later.}
{642}{}{I understand. Well, thanks for your time, First Citizen.}
{643}{lyn103}{A spy for NCR? That... that... would explain a great many things. Thank you, Citizen. I
 will deal with this immediately.}
{644}{}{Eu tenho mais algumas perguntas...}
{645}{}{Great, thanks. Goodbye.}
{646}{}{Thank you, First Citizen.}
{647}{lyn104}{They started several months ago. The laser turrets have been able to hold them off, but I
 don't know how much longer we can stop them.}
{648}{}{Quem são estes raiders?}
{649}{}{Eu tenho mais algumas perguntas...}
{650}{}{I have to be going. Goodbye.}
{651}{}{I'm sorry to hear that; perhaps they will go elsewhere in search of easier targets. Good day, First Citizen.}
{652}{lyn105}{Outsider trash. For over a century, Outsiders have tried to loot our city... and have
 always failed. Eventually, we will defeat this group.}
{653}{}{Uh... "eventually?" Why haven't you wiped them out already?}
{654}{}{Posso te fazer outra pergunta?}
{655}{}{I have to be going. Goodbye.}
{656}{}{I have to go. Good day, First Citizen.}
{657}{lyn106}{Finding their base has proven difficult. In addition, they also have a great deal of
 firepower. Nevertheless, we have repelled every attack... with minimal casualties.}
{658}{}{Posso te fazer outra pergunta?}
{659}{}{I have to be going. Goodbye.}
{660}{}{Thanks for your time. Good day, First Citizen.}
{661}{lyn107}{What is it? }
{662}{}{I found their base. They're holed up in a series of caves in the foothills to the South.}
{663}{}{I wiped them out. They were holed up in a series of caves in the foothills to the South.}
{664}{}{Information has its price.}
{665}{}{Deixa pra lá. Eu tenho que ir.}
{666}{lyn108}{You have? Excellent! But the city guards are already stretched thin... What about you?
 Could you end the attacks? I'll pay you.}
{667}{}{No, I'm too busy at the moment.}
{668}{}{Eu vou ver o que posso fazer.}
{669}{lyn109}{Very well. If you'll excuse me, I am also very busy. You can find your own way out.}
{670}{}{I had some other questions I wanted to ask you first...}
{671}{}{Muito bem, estou saindo.}
{672}{}{Very well. Good day, First Citizen.}
{673}{lyn110a}{Mercenaries? Who hired them?}
{674}{lyn110b}{Yes, I believe you mentioned that before. Do you know who hired them?}
{675}{}{I'm betting it was the Bishop Family in New Reno. }
{676}{}{The Bishop Family in New Reno.}
{677}{}{I'm not sure yet. I'm still looking into it.}
{678}{lyn111a}{What?! How do you know this? What evidence do you have?}
{679}{lyn111b}{Do you have any evidence?}
{680}{}{I don't have any actual proof, but word in New Reno is that the Bishops are behind it.}
{681}{}{I found this account book in the raiders' safe listing payments from Bishop for a three-month
 campaign of terror against your city... uh, with options for one-month extensions if you were stubborn.}
{682}{}{I don't really have any hard evidence. I'm still working on it. }
{683}{lyn112}{I would not be surprised. Bishop visited Vault City not long ago, and suggested an
 alliance. I refused, of course. We don't associate with criminals.}
{684}{}{Maybe this was his way of forcing you into an alliance.}
{685}{lyn113}{I would sooner ask NCR for help. If you come across any hard evidence of Bishop's
 involvement, please bring it to me at once.}
{686}{}{Fair enough. I had some other questions...}
{687}{}{If I find out anything, I'll let you know.}
{688}{}{I will, First Citizen. Good day.}
{689}{lyn114}{I'm not surprised. Bishop visited not long ago and suggested an alliance. I refused, of
 course. We don't associate with criminals.}
{690}{}{I think he expected that. I found this holodisc in Bishop's safe. He was hired by NCR to get
 Vault City to join the Republic. When you refused his offer, he hired the mercenaries to attack you
 so you would ask NCR for help.}
{691}{}{Maybe this was his way of forcing you into an alliance.}
{692}{lyn115}{Possibly... but it would never work. I would sooner ask NCR for help. You have done Vault
 City a great service. Please take this as a token of our appreciation.}
{693}{}{Obrigado. Eu tenho algumas outras questões...}
{694}{}{If I hear anything more, I'll let you know.}
{695}{}{My pleasure, First Citizen. Good day.}
{696}{lyn116}{Of course. They sent mercenaries to murder my people because I wouldn't join their
 government? I... I can barely believe it.}
{697}{}{It gets even more complicated. Thomas Moore is also involved.}
{698}{}{Is there anything I could do to help?}
{699}{}{It's a rough world. Anyway, about compens -- }
{700}{lyn117}{This is not the conduct of a Citizen. But I need this information. What is your price?}
{701}{}{$100}
{702}{}{$200}
{703}{}{$400}
{704}{}{$500}
{705}{}{Never mind. I'll tell you the information I have for free.}
{706}{lyn118}{Very well, here is your money. Now tell me what you know.}
{707}{}{I found their base. They're holed up in a series of caves in the foothills to the South.}
{708}{}{I wiped them out. They were holed up in a series of caves in the foothills to the South.}
{709}{}{Actually, I don't really know much of anything.}
{710}{}{Thanks for the cash. I have to be going now.}
{711}{lyn119}{I need you to go immediately to New California Republic and find Counselor Westin,
 Roger Westin. Give him the holodisk. That should insure that no more "raiders" get hired.}
{712}{}{Uh... didn't you hear? Westin's dead. I mean, he had an accident. A deadly one. It's a long story.}
{713}{}{Wait a minute. Go to NCR? Weren't they responsible for all this?}
{714}{}{All right, I'll do it. }
{715}{}{No thanks. I'm too busy as it is.}
{716}{lyn120}{Roger Westin was probably the only honest man in the New Republic and a sympathetic
 to our cause... his death is a terrible loss.}
{717}{}{Yeah, he was a tough old fella. Good guy. Lot of hit points. So... do I still get a reward for
 finding all this information out for you, or...?}
{718}{}{Yeah, I was sorry to hear about it, too. It was like I just saw him yesterday.}
{719}{lyn121a}{I recall already paying you for information regarding these "raiders." You have been compensated. Now leave.}
{720}{lyn121b}{Yes, yes... you have done very well. Please... take this as a reward.}
{721}{}{No reward?! Finding out all this political bullshit was no easy task. I think I deserve something extra, don't you?!}
{722}{}{Hold on, I'm not done yet. I had some other questions...}
{723}{}{Muito bem, estou saindo.}
{724}{}{Obrigado. Eu tenho algumas outras questões...}
{725}{}{Great! Thanks... I better be going now.}
{726}{}{Thank you, First Citizen.}
{727}{lyn122}{Roger Westin is probably the only honest man in the New Republic and sympathetic to our cause. }
{728}{}{All right, I'll deliver the disk to him.}
{729}{}{No thanks. I'm too busy right now.}
{730}{lyn123}{Your patriotism will not go unrewarded. Go now. Time is of the essence.}
{731}{}{Before I go, I had some other questions...}
{732}{}{Eu estou trabalhando nisso.}
{733}{}{You can count on me, First Citizen. I'll return after I have delivered the disk to Westin.}
{734}{lyn124}{Nevertheless, Vault City will prevail. You have performed a valuable service...
 please accept this token of our appreciation.}
{735}{}{Obrigado. Eu tenho algumas outras questões...}
{736}{}{Great! Thanks... I better be going now.}
{737}{}{Thank you, First Citizen.}
{738}{lyn125}{Have you delivered it?}
{739}{}{No. I was wondering, what is the reward you spoke of?}
{740}{}{No, I'm too busy to deliver the disk.}
{741}{}{No, not yet. But I had some questions...}
{742}{}{I delivered the disk to Counselor Westin.}
{743}{}{Not yet. I'll be back when I do.}
{744}{}{Not yet, First Citizen. I'll return when I've delivered it to Westin.}
{745}{lyn126}{You will?! Excellent! Take the disk you got from Bishop and hurry. Time is of the essence.}
{746}{}{Before I go, I had some other questions...}
{747}{}{Eu estou trabalhando nisso.}
{748}{}{You can count on me, First Citizen. I'll return after I have delivered the disk to Westin.}
{749}{lyn127}{Believe me, you will not be disappointed. Now please deliver that holodisk.}
{750}{}{Before I go, I had some other questions...}
{751}{}{All right. I'm on it.}
{752}{}{You can count on me, First Citizen. I'll return after I have delivered the disk to Westin.}
{753}{lyn128}{I can see that our agreement meant nothing to you. Very well then; your Vault City privileges
 are revoked. My guards will escort you to the front gate.}
{754}{}{I'll kill those guards... after I kill you.}
{755}{}{Okay! Here, take the disk, and I'll go. }
{756}{lyn129}{Thank you! You have done a great service! Did Westin send back correspondence?}
{757}{}{Yes, I'm starting to feel like the Postman. Here, he wanted me to give you this disk.}
{758}{}{No, I lost it.}
{759}{}{No, he never gave me one.}
{760}{lyn130a}{Excellent. Let me scan this.}
{761}{}{Fade out 3 seconds}
{762}{lyn130b}{We will not have problems with NCR for a very long time. }
{763}{}{That's good news.}
{764}{lyn131}{Now... regarding payment: Report to Randal, the Chief Amenities Officer. Tell him I sent
 you, and he will present you with your reward. Thank you again. }
{765}{}{Before I go, I had some other questions...}
{766}{}{All right. Reward, here I come.}
{767}{}{Thank you, First Citizen. Good day.}
{768}{lyn132}{Your service has been exemplary. So much so that it is my honor to name you Captain of the
 Guard. Congratulations, Captain. You deserve it.}
{769}{}{Uh... thanks.}
{770}{}{Thank you, First Citizen.}
{771}{lyn133}{In addition, report to Randal, the Chief Amenities Officer. Tell him I sent you, and
 receive your reward. We are in your debt... Captain.}
{772}{}{Before I go, I had some other questions...}
{773}{}{Tudo bem. Recompensa, aí vou eu!}
{774}{}{Thank you, First Citizen. Good day.}
{775}{lyn134}{Você perdeu?! Essa correspondência era extremamente importante! Muito bem...
 aqui está o seu pagamento pela entrega do disco. Agora, se me der licença... }
{776}{}{Espere um minuto. Antes de ir, tenho outras perguntas...}
{777}{}{Até logo.}
{778}{}{Bom dia, Primeira Cidadã.}
{779}{lyn135}{Ele não te deu nada? Estranho... de qualquer forma, aqui está o seu pagamento pela
 entrega do disco. Agora, se me der licença...}
{780}{}{Espere um minuto. Antes de ir, tenho outras perguntas...}
{781}{}{Até logo.}
{782}{}{Bom dia, Primeira Cidadã.}
{783}{lyn136}{O que é isso?}
{784}{}{Encontrei este holodisco no cofre de Bishop. ELE foi contratado pela NCR para fazer
 com que Vault City se juntasse à República. Quando você recusou sua oferta inicial, ele contratou os
 mercenários para atacá-lo para que você pedisse ajuda ao NCR.}
{785}{lyn099}{What do you mean?}
{786}{}{Moore's actually working for the New California Republic.}
{787}{lyn138}{Um espião da NCR? Isso... isso... explicaria muitas coisas. Obrigado por expor isso, Cidadão.
 ESSE problema eu posso resolver imediatamente.}
{788}{}{Sobre o problema da NCR... há algo que eu possa fazer para ajudar?}
{789}{}{Isso é bom de ouvir. De qualquer forma, para descobrir todas essas coisas sobre Reno e NCR, Eu queria saber se haveria uma recomp -- }
{790}{}{Guardas!}

{821}{}{Eu vou levar isso.}
{822}{}{Me dê isso.}
{823}{}{Eu não sei nada sobre isso.}
{824}{}{Eu não sei.}
{825}{}{Sim.}
{826}{}{Não.}

 do disco fosse para os distritos externos da NCR, eles nunca seriam confiáveis novamente.}
{843}{}{Minhas fontes em Gecko me garantem que ainda existem ghouls na cidade. A sua Cidadania
 depende de resolver esta situação... completamente. Estou sendo claro?}
{844}{}{Desculpe, pensei que tinha matado todos eles.}
{845}{}{É um bom começo, mas nossa água subterrânea ainda está sendo contaminada. Você
 precisa desativar a central deles.}
{846}{}{Isso ajuda, mas não elimina nosso problema principal: a contaminação das águas subterrâneas.
 Você precisa impedir que a usina vaze radiação.}
{847}{}{A Anciã da minha aldeia me deu um cantil de água, mas não tenho aqui comigo. Ainda assim,
 as histórias que a Anciã nos contou diziam que meu ancestral era de ums Vault.}
{848}{}{Você quer dizer dos ghouls? Sim, descobri o que há de errado com a central deles.}
{849}{}{The plant needs a hydro-magnet, uh, thingie to make it work. The ghouls
 said you had one here, so I just need that, and they can make the plant clean.}
{850}{}{They need a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator to fix the plant and
 prevent it from polluting the groundwater. They claim you have one here in Vault City. So if I could
 get the part...}
{851}{}{Never mind. We can talk about this some other time.}
{852}{lyn047b}{What if we do? That is only a temporary solution.}
{853}{}{Uh, well, I don't know the specifics, but it sounds like the magneto-thingie could help both
 Gecko and Vault City. Can I get the part?}
{854}{}{Actually, the regulator could make the plant run clean for many years. So if I could just get the part...?}
{855}{}{Never mind. Maybe I can find someone else to help me.}
{856}{}{You are correct, First Citizen. I'll see what I can do to handle this problem on my own.}
{857}{}{I don't think I understand. Is there some problem with Gecko... or the ghouls?}
{858}{}{First Citizen, please hear me out... is there some problem with getting the part? It could
 solve your problems with Gecko and help the ghouls, too...}
{859}{}{Nevermind. Maybe I can find someone else to help me.}
{860}{}{Sorry for disturbing you, First Citizen.}
{861}{}{They aren't trying to hurt anyone. They just don't have the part they need to make
 the plant run cleanly. So, if you could please GIVE me the part...}
{862}{}{Never mind. Maybe I can find someone else to help me.}
{863}{}{Very well. Sorry to disturb you, First Citizen.}
{864}{lyn017b}{You barge into my chambers and then have the audacity to make demands of ME, Lynette, First Citizen of Vault City?!}
{865}{lyn041c}{Agora saia imediatamente, ou chamarei os guardas.}
{866}{}{That does it. You're in bad need of a painful lesson.}
{867}{}{Never mind. Maybe I can find someone else to help me.}
{868}{}{Sorry for disturbing you, First Citizen.}
{869}{}{I need a part to fix the Gecko power plant.}
{870}{}{You delivered Westin's holodisk to Lynette.}
{871}{}{You delivered Westin's holodisk to Lynette and became Captain of the Guard.}
{872}{}{You have wiped out the raiders and helped Vault City.}
{873}{}{You have exposed Moore as a spy for NCR.}

{880}{}{Sorry to bother you, then. Goodbye.}
{881}{}{That's good to hear. So...?}
