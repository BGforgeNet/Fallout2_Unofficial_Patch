{100}{}{Você vê o padre Tully.}
{150}{}{Você vê um homem idoso em vestes marrons e manchas vermelhas nas bochechas por causa do uísque. Ele parece um pouco instável.}
{151}{}{Você vê o padre Tully. Ele parece estar de ressaca. }
{200}{}{Eu sou muitobençoado.}
{201}{}{E as mulheres devem me cumprimentar com um beijo santo.}
{202}{}{Expulsarei o demônio de mim bebendo se for possível.}
{203}{}{Um verdadeiro sermão não tem palavras...}
{204}{}{Eu sinto o Todopoderoso em mim.}
{205}{}{Maldição, estou ficando sóbrio. Preciso de uma bebida.}
{206}{}{Por que o chão tá dando umas voltas...}
{207}{}{Uma garrafa de bebida vai me ajudar a falar em línguas.}
{208}{}{Um quinto de licor mataria esse diabo na minha cabeça.}
{209}{}{Oooh. Já tem uma hora desde a última vez que tomei um gole...}
{210}{}{Hora de absorver o espírito santo.}
{211}{}{Eu bebo em nome de tudo o que é sagrado.}
{220}{}{Quer saber o que a igreja acha sobre a felação?}
{221}{}{Pecado! Maldade! Eh... o que você vai fazer depois?}
{222}{}{Vadia! Prostituta! Puta! Ei... o que você vai fazer mais tarde?}
{225}{}{Quem é você? Te conheço? }
{226}{}{Saudaççções... o que o padre Tully pode fazer por você... }
{227}{}{Você venceu a Enclave como um... um... deus, né? Você é um herói.}
{228}{}{Eu rerói}
{229}{}{Eu vou}
{230}{}{Eu enfrentei a Enclave, sim. Eles começaram - e eu terminei. Mas não me entenda mal, padre. Sou apenas um
 homem tentando abrir caminho neste mundo implacável... Não sou um herói.}
{231}{}{Eu enfrentei a Enclave, sim. Eles começaram - e eu terminei. Mas não me entenda mal, padre. Sou apenas uma
 mulher tentando abrir caminho neste mundo implacável... Não sou um heroína.}
{232}{}{É melhor eu ir, padre. Fiquei feliz em sentir o seu cheiro... digo, em vê-lo.}
{235}{}{Você é um HERRRÓI. Eu tenho ago pra você. Não sei o que podia servir, mas imagino que você possa estar precisando.}
{236}{}{Eu pego}
{237}{}{Não preciso... eu quero ir lá fora}
{238}{}{Certo. Eu aceito o que você está dando, padre. Uh, bem, dentro dos limites da decência.}
{239}{}{Er... não, obrigado, padre. Eu realmente preciso ir.}
{240}{}{(Tully vai até um dos bancos, arranca uma tábua do assento e tira um livro de capa mole encardido.) Aqui está. É um
 pouco sujo, mas... (entrega para você.)}
{241}{}{Brigado}
{242}{}{Obrigado, padre. Acho.}
{245}{}{Você é um herói. Ocê merece. Não são os muitos jogadoress TERMINAM os joogoss, mas você foi e fez. Estou
 orgulhoso de você. Tooooda NEW RENO está orgulhosa de você.}
{246}{}{Brigado, padre. Tchaaau}
{247}{}{Obrigado, padre. Se cuida, tá ouvindo?}
{250}{}{Saudaççções, meu filho. O que o padre Tully pode fazer por você nessa... preciosa noite em Reno?}
{251}{}{Saudaçççõões, meu filho. O que o padre Tully pode fazer por você neste... bom dia em Reno?}
{252}{}{Hee-hee. Você fede chacaça. Você fede xixi}
{253}{}{Eu gosto do sol}
{254}{}{Noite bonita.}
{255}{}{Eh, na verdade é de dia, padre.}
{256}{}{Eh, na verdade é de noite, padre.}
{257}{}{Quem é você?}
{258}{}{Está bêbado?}
{259}{}{'Padre' Tully, eh? Você pode fazer divórcios?}
{261}{}{Olhe, eu trouxe um pouco de bebida, padre. Podemos conversar um momento...?}
{262}{}{Nada. Desculpe por atrapalhar.}
{270}{}{(Cheira seu suvaco e depois suas vestes.) Minha palavra, com certeza um cheiro forte, né? Maldição, eu ccheiro
 como um alambique! Melhor me limpar antes que Sssenhora Wright me ache...}
{271}{}{Tchau homem mijo}
{275}{}{Inferno, devo ter dormido demais... teria notado de outra forma... o que diabos eu estava dizendo?}
{290}{}{Padre Tully, a seu serviço. Sou o conselheiro espiritual do bom p... bem, do povo de New Reno.}
{291}{}{Estar bêbado é a única maneira de conseguir isso?}
{292}{}{Eu tenho algumas perguntas sobre New Reno...}
{295}{}{I see. Well, thanks for talking with me.}
{300}{}{Certintly not! In th' PAST, I was known to indulge in th'spirits, but th' Temperance Union has helped me break th' filthy habit!}
{301}{}{The Temper --?}
{302}{}{Oh. I didn't --}
{303}{}{Break th --?}
{305}{}{Temprance Union, Misssus Wright... same pershun. Tryin' ta clean up New Reeno. Done a pretty good job with me.}
{306}{}{Claro que sim. Eu tenho algumas outras perguntas...}
{315}{}{Queshions? Can't say I know tooo much 'bout them. But ast away.}
{316}{}{Você já ouviu falar do Vault 13?}
{317}{}{I'm here because I'm looking for my tribe. They were kidnapped from my village.}
{318}{}{You don't know how to fix an oil tanker, do you?}
{319}{}{Have you heard about something called the Garden of Eden Creation Kit?}
{320}{}{Can you tell me a little bit about New Reno?}
{323}{}{Maybe I'll come back when you're a little drier.}
{325}{}{Well... Reno... itz... well, itz... well... um, say...}
{326}{}{A Garden o' Eden Creashun Kit? Nope. Can't say I've ever heard of one. Say, um...}
{327}{}{Vault thurteen? No idea... well, I mean, therez Vault CITY to th' northeast. That what you lookin' for, maybe? Hmmmm... say, um...}
{328}{}{Slaverz, maybe? Heard thaz where they get a lotta their stock... um... say...}
{329}{}{Tanker? Thing with treads an' a barrel...? Don't know much 'bout that....um... say...}
{330}{}{Yes...?}
{335}{}{Pardon me for asking, do you happenta have a bottle on you? I need sum fer th' services... and, eh, my throatz a little dry.}
{336}{}{Sure. Here ya go.}
{337}{}{Not on me, I'm afraid.}
{338}{}{I could go snag some, if you want.}
{440}{}{Now I'm onna straight and narrow, thankz to Missus Wright... bless her soul. I've been clean fer almost a... uh, month. Or wazzit
 a week? Aw, hell, I don't know. }
{441}{}{Uma semana deve ser difícil. Olha, eu tenho outras perguntas para você...}
{442}{}{Dry as sand, huh? How many fingers am I holding up?}
{443}{}{União da Temperança?}
{444}{}{Missus Wright?}
{445}{}{Maybe I'll come back when you're sober.}
{450}{}{(Tully stumbles over to the poor box beside the podium, and fishes around inside.) }
{451}{}{Uh... hmmnn. (His hands come up empty.) Afraid I haven't got any chipz afterall.}
{452}{}{Hmnnn. Here ya go...(He dumps some chips into your hand.) Blesst be the poor. Go spend in the name of all that is holee.}
{453}{}{Thanks anyway, Father. I'll see if I can scrounge up some hootch.}
{454}{}{Thanks, Father. I'll be back with the hootch soon.}
{460}{}{Don't give two secondz to 'is whife n' daughter... no wonder both o' em have grown up wiiild.
 Heh-heh... all comez out in th' confessional, y'know...}
{461}{}{Oh, and what does Mr. Bishop say in the confessional?}
{462}{}{Oh, and what does Mrs. Bishop say in the confessional?}
{463}{}{What does Mrs. Bishop say in the confessional? She doesn't talk about me, does she... I mean, cause there's
 nothing to talk about. All lies.}
{464}{}{Oh, and what does Bishop's daughter say in the confessional?}
{465}{}{Uh, what does Bishop's daughter say in the confessional? Nothing about me, I ho... er, nothing bad, I hope.}
{466}{}{I imagine. Can I ask you some other questions, Father?}
{470}{}{Naw, Vault City told him ta STICK it up his poopchute. So... not long after, Vault City starts getting raided. Fast.
 Hard. An' all th' while, right there is Bischop, telling 'em, "I COULD help, IF you join with New Reno."}
{471}{}{Hmmm. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
{472}{}{So, blackmail's Bishop's game? A few raids, a few deaths, and Vault City might be ready to be friends with New Reno.
 Not too subtle, but effective. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
{473}{}{That seems an odd tactic... I mean, it's much more likely Vault City would try and get help from someone else before
 caving into Bishop's pressure. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
{474}{}{That seems an odd tactic... I mean, it's much more likely Vault City would try and get help from someone else... like
 NCR, for example... before caving into Bishop's pressure. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
{475}{}{Can I ask you some other questions, Father?}
{476}{}{Very interesting, Father. Thanks for talking with me.}
{480}{}{(Stares at your hand.) Izzat six? Or izzit three...}
{481}{}{Very good. Both of those are right. Say, I had some questions...}
{482}{}{Can you do divorces?}
{484}{}{Maybe I'll come back when you sober up.}
{490}{}{Devil take me, 'course I can! Reno waz th' divorce capital even 'fore th' Big One. }
{491}{}{This th' filly you wanna break vows with? }
{492}{}{This th' stud you wanna break vows with? }
{493}{}{(Looks confused for a moment as he stares at both of you. Then he shrugs, drinks.)}
{494}{}{You bet. Can we start now?}
{495}{}{Talvez... mas ainda estou pensando nisso. Eu pretendo estar de volta, no entanto.}
{500}{}{Well, I seem to have misplaced my sermon book with all the offishul stuff...}
{501}{}{Screw the book. Here's some hootch. Can you just make something up?}
{502}{}{Here's some hooch. Can you just make something up?}
{503}{}{Screw the book. If I bring you a bottle, think you could just make up something?}
{504}{}{If I bring you a bottle, think you could just make up something?}
{505}{}{Oh, well. Maybe the book'll turn up.}
{510}{}{Well, it wouldn't be right... unless the hootch was reeeally good.}
{511}{}{No fear. I'll be back.}
{512}{}{Well, I can go get some. But I'll need some chips first.}
{520}{}{Sure! Lemme just polish thiz off, git th' fire going...(He downs the bottle with frightening speed.)...all right then, step up to th' podium, you two...}
{521}{}{Mais um passo...}
{530}{}{Oh. All right then. No harm in asking... so... uh... I'm sorry, who are you again?}
{531}{}{You know, I could go snag some hootch for you, if you want.}
{540}{}{Now there's a fine idea! May you be thrice-blesst! Eh... I happen t'know a PLACE on th' East Side, at the old train
 station, that sells th' kind of holy water I need.}
{541}{}{Okay. I'll go get some. Be right back.}
{542}{}{Okay. I'll go get some. But I'll need some chips to buy it.}
{550}{}{Courze, a courze... chipz, chipz... where do I keep the chipz...(His eyes turn to the poor box beside the podium.) Ah! Don't
 know why I didn't think of this before... Houl onna minute...}
{551}{}{Patiently wait for him to make the withdrawal from the poor box.}
{552}{}{Uh, nevermind, Father. This one's on me.}
{560}{}{(Father Tully glances at the... now... empty bottle in his hands.) Say, don't mean to impose, friend: would yoo happenta
 have 'nother bottle of that fine vintage on you? All thiz talkin' is making me parsched.}
{570}{}{Thank you kindly! (Takes bottle, takes a swig.) Ahhh... sorry... what in the hells was I talking about?}
{571}{}{Eh... well, now, most certintly! (Takes bottle.) Don't usually touch the stuff, y'know...(Takes a deep drink.)...ahhhh... um, sorry, what waz I saying?}
{572}{}{Eh... damn kind of you! (Takes bottle.) Don't usually drink this much, y'know...(Takes a long swig.) Ahhhh... I'm sorry, what was I saying?}
{573}{}{You were talking about family Bishop.}
{574}{}{You were talking about family Wright.}
{575}{}{You were talking about family Mordino.}
{576}{}{You were talking about family Salvatore.}
{578}{}{You were talking about Richard Wright's death.}
{579}{}{I'll come back when you're sober.}
{590}{}{Eh? The Bishops, right... power-hungry's the lotta 'em, itz in th' blood. Thing is, ol' John Bischop iz so concerned
 'bout taking over everthin' he ain't taking care of business at hoome...}
{591}{}{Business at home?}
{600}{}{Well, not much, but I hear thingz OUSSIDE th' confessional about oul' Bishop. Crafty devil. Got iron ballz, he
 does... must clink when he walkz. I figger he'z behind thosse raidz on Vault City... you heard 'bout those?}
{601}{}{Não.}
{602}{}{Sim.}
{603}{}{Father, keep it down. That kind of talk could get you killed in this town...}
{604}{}{Look, maybe I'll come back when you're sober.}
{610}{}{(Ignores you.) See, a few months back, oul' Bishop sends a caravan to Vault City, SUGGESTING a marriage o' convenience 'tween
 Vault City n' New Reno.}
{611}{}{Did they reach an agreement?}
{612}{}{I trust they didn't reach an agreement?}
{620}{}{Mostly what you'd 'xpect from a neglected wifey-o with a body whoose curves could cure th' blind. Mostly adultery.
 I mean, have you SEEN her rack? My word!}
{621}{}{Uh... o que mais pode me dizer sobre os bispos, padre?}
{622}{}{Yeah, she does have a nice rack. I mean... so I've heard. Uh, what else can you tell me about the Bishops, Father?}
{623}{}{Er... she didn't say WHO she was adulterous with, did she, Father?}
{625}{}{Agreed. Well, thanks for talking with me.}
{630}{}{Oooh, sweeeet little Angela? Little HELLION more like it! Girl's got too mucha deevil in her britches. Always
 floozying around, banging her father's help n' pumping herself fulla Jet...}
{631}{}{Uh, banging her father's help? Did she say who?}
{632}{}{Jet?}
{633}{}{This sounds like a great family. What else can you tell me about the Bishops?}
{634}{}{Eu tenho algumas outras perguntas, padre...}
{635}{}{I guess children will be children. Well, thanks for talking with me.}
{640}{}{Who? A-course she did, but th' list a-who she DIDN'T fool around with would be easier to name off. She tells everyone,
 bragssz 'bout it. Say... what waz yer name again?}
{641}{}{Uh, nada... o que mais você pode me dizer sobre os bispos, padre?}
{642}{}{Me? Celibate monks such as myself don't have names. Say, I did have some other questions, Father...}
{643}{}{Me? Celibate nuns such as myself don't have names. Say, I did have some other questions, Father...}
{644}{}{Talk to you later, Father.}
{650}{}{Devil's blood! Wickedness! Foul secretion from th' very teat of evil!}
{651}{}{Então... você não gosta de Jet?}
{652}{}{Uh, yes. Teat of evil. Can I ask you some other questions, Father?}
{653}{}{All right then. Talk to you later, Father.}
{660}{}{That drug'll be th' death of us. Can't think of another drug...(Drinks, belches.)...that doess more damage than Jet... Killz
 th' mind and th' body. Damn Mordinos...}
{661}{}{What was that about the Mordinos?}
{663}{}{Uh, I'd nurse that bottle a little longer next time, Father. Talk to you later.}
{670}{}{Heh-heh! Wright, eh? (Smiles, wiggles eyebrows.) Lemme tell you a lit-tle sumthin' about th' WRIGHTS... they're a split
 bunch of horny drunks and stonefast puritans, they are!}
{671}{}{Oh, really?}
{672}{}{I think I've heard enough, Father. Thanks for talking with me.}
{680}{}{Those Wrights just keep squeezing out kids... oul' Orville Wright must wanna re-pop-ulate th' world. Hope Missus Wright
 can take th' strain. Heh-heh. An' the thingz they SAY in th' confessional...}
{681}{}{Oh, really? What does Missus Wright say in the confessional?}
{682}{}{Oh, really? What does ol' ORVILLE Wright say in the confessional?}
{683}{}{What does the Wright Family control in New Reno?}
{684}{}{Oh, I bet it's really juicy stuff. Maybe we can talk about it some other time.}
{690}{}{ETHYL Wright? That blesst woman! Keeps me off th' drink, an' on th' straight n' narrow. (Takes a swig.) She can drive th' sin
 outta you, she can... uh, but... what in hell waz I saying?}
{691}{}{About Missus Wright in the confessional...}
{692}{}{Estava falando com a família Wright...}
{693}{}{Esqueça. Eu tenho outras perguntas}
{694}{}{Nothing much more, I think. Thanks for talking with me.}
{700}{}{Oh, right, right. Well, uh, in th' confessional, she ain't got much t'say. Mostly guilt 'bout stepping on bugs... or 'bout
 enjoying sex with her hubbie too much. Heh-heh. (Takes a swig.) I looove guilt.}
{701}{}{Eu tenho algumas perguntas sobre os Wrights...}
{702}{}{Entendo. Eu tenho outras perguntas...}
{703}{}{It shows. Thanks for talking with me.}
{710}{}{Oul' Orville? Well, he's got a lotta guilt on his shoulders. See, he promised th' Missus he'd quit the alcohol biz, but
 he has a secret still in th' train station behind th' house! She'll beat him uglier than he is if she finds it...}
{711}{}{Heh-heh, herez the funny bit... y'see, ol Mr. Wright promised the Missus he'd quit the alcohol biz, but he has a secret
 still in the train station behind the house! Ha! She'll beat him uglier than he is if she finds it...}
{712}{}{Me conte sobre a senhora Wright...}
{713}{}{Me conte mais sobre os Wrights...}
{715}{}{A secret still in the train station behind the house, huh? Very interesting, Father. Thanks for the info.}
{720}{}{Nuthin'! (Takes a drink.) They're the weakest of th' families, cuz they only brew alke-hol. Barely turn a cent, they do.
 Th' other families buy alke-hol offa them mostly outta pity.}
{721}{}{Where does this alcohol come from?}
{722}{}{Interessante. Me diga mais sobre os Wrights...}
{724}{}{Very interesting, Father. Thanks for the info.}
{730}{}{Th'Mordinos? (Holds up three fingers.) Therez two o' them. (Holds hand up high.) Big Jeezus... (Holds hand down low.) ...an' Leetle
 Jeezus. The Father n' the Son. They control th' drugs and the whoa-men in Reno.}
{731}{}{Tell me about Big Jesus.}
{732}{}{Tell me about Little Jesus.}
{733}{}{So they are the source of drugs and control most of the whores in New Reno?}
{740}{}{Jesus? He's one bad muthuh...(Takes a swig, swishes it around in cheeks.) Deals in slavez, Jet, n' whores. Only person
 worse'n him is hiz filthy son.}
{741}{}{His son?}
{742}{}{So Jesus Mordino Senior controls most of the drugs and whores in New Reno?}
{743}{}{Great family. Can I ask you some other questions, Father?}
{744}{}{Like father, like son. Well, thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{750}{}{Leetle Jezus? Bastard! He's like a prairie tick, sucking blood from hiz Dad's work. Be trouble for alla Reno if he took
 charge. Couldn't hold it toogether, drugz, whorez... all fall down.}
{752}{}{The Mordinos are the source of drugs and most of the whores in New Reno?}
{754}{}{Just like you in a few seconds. Well, thanks for talking with me.}
{760}{}{(Tully stares at you.) }
{761}{}{Yesss... (Smiles, licks lips.) ...whoresss... (Begins stroking neck of the bottle.)}
{762}{}{Uh, Father? About the drugs?}
{763}{}{I think I better go. Thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{770}{}{Eh? Drugz... yes, the drugs. Jet. Filthy Jet. Do horrible thingz with it, horrible... Redding... the Stables. (Takes a swig.) All fer gold...}
{772}{}{What about Redding?}
{773}{}{What about the Stables?}
{775}{}{Interesting. Thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{780}{}{(Makes a walking motion with his two fingers.) Jet leavez town, goez ta Redding. Gold leavez Redding, goez to Mordino.
 (Takes a swig.) Miners die, Mordinos lie.}
{782}{}{What were you saying about the Stables?}
{784}{}{So the Mordinos are selling Jet to Redding, huh? Interesting. Thanks, Father.}
{790}{}{Mordinos havva... farm... ousside of town. Keep slaves there. Test... Jet... on them. Killz them in drovez. (Shudders.) Only th' Mordinos
 know where th' Stables are.}
{792}{}{What were you saying about Redding?}
{794}{}{The Mordinos are testing Jet on slaves, huh? Interesting. Thanks, Father.}
{800}{}{I wuz talking 'bout the Salvatores? (Blinks, shrugs, then drinks.) Can't imagine what I was saying. Family's as silent as
 death. An' you don't wanna cross 'em, either... know why?}
{803}{}{Don't really need to know why right now, Father. Can I ask you some other questions?}
{804}{}{Look, maybe I'll come back when you're sober.}
{810}{}{(Lumbers on drunkenly.) Cuz they got weapons like fires from heaven, weapons no one's ever SEEN before in New Reno or
 nowhere. Shoot beams of light, cut a man in two, leave him twitching in the dust.}
{811}{}{Shoot beams of light?}
{812}{}{Shoot beams of light? You mean laser weapons?}
{814}{}{Wow... maybe I should try and get a hold of one. Well, thanks for talking with me.}
{820}{}{Thaz what I heard them call them... lay-sers... but ta me, those weapons are the devil's own, foul lightbringers, tools
 meant for nuthin but death!}
{821}{}{Yes, of course, Father. Tools of the devil and all that. What do the other families think of these 'lightbringers?'}
{823}{}{Tools of the devil, huh? Maybe I should try and get a hold of one. Well, thanks for talking with me.}
{830}{}{One of them lightbringers can kill a dozen men... Other families useta fight with th' Salvatores, but now no one messes
 with 'em. Itz a peace of sorts... good as long azzit holds out, I s'pose.}
{831}{}{Who's in charge of the Salvatores, Father?}
{833}{}{I suppose. Well, thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{840}{}{Louie... LOUIS... Salvatore runz th' show. (Drains bottle, coughs slightly.) Cripple. Needz an oxygen tank ta keep breathin'... his
 lungs are messed up. Stays in th' top floor of his establishment, never comes out.}
{841}{}{Interesting. Can I ask you some other questions, Father?}
{842}{}{Hmmmm. Tank of oxygen, huh? Interesting. Well, thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{850}{}{That poor boy... Jet took him from his family, it did. That damnable stuff! Worst mind poison ever made...}
{852}{}{Do you know where Richard got the Jet that killed him?}
{853}{}{Eu tenho mais algumas perguntas...}
{854}{}{I see. Thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{860}{}{He coulda gotten it from anyone in New Reno! There's a pharmacy jest cross th' street run by a drug dealer, and if
 he's not selling, stop an' ask anyone on th' street! Damn Jet!}
{862}{}{The pharmacy across the street? I'll check it out. Thanks for talking with me, Father.}
{957}{}{Tudo bem, es-escuta...}
