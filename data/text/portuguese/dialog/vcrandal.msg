{100}{}{You see Randal, the Chief Amenities Officer.}
{101}{}{You see a middle-aged man with thinning black hair.}
{102}{}{You see Randal, the Chief Amenities Officer.}
{103}{}{You see a middle-aged man with thinning black hair.}
{104}{}{Congratulations, }
{105}{}{Way to put those Enclave assh-... er, jerks, in their place!}
{106}{}{I heard you kicked some major tail down south. Way to go.}
{107}{}{An intruder! Guards! Guards!}
{108}{}{Wh-?! A mutant! Guards!}
{109}{}{Wh-? A ghoul! Guards!}
{110}{}{Bom dia, Capitão.}
{111}{}{Vault City prevails, Capitão.}
{112}{}{Bom dia, Citizen.}
{113}{}{Vault City prevails, Citizen.}
{114}{}{Need to send distribution charts to Sub-Amenities Offices A and B...}
{115}{}{Need to compile the latest stock inventories and put them on the list server...}
{116}{}{I miss DOS. This new operating system makes it harder to enter lists.}
{117}{}{The First Citizen still needs those inventory lists...}
{118}{}{Sorry, we're closed for the evening. Come back in the morning.}
{119}{}{We're closed. I'm just compiling these lists before I head home.}
{120}{}{Hello there, stranger. Always a pleasure to see a new face. Name's Randal... I'm the Chief Amenities Officer. Need something?}
{121}{}{Gechkk}
{122}{}{Nooooooooo-pe}
{123}{}{Desliga}
{124}{}{Well, it depends. What is this place?}
{125}{}{Nothing today, actually.}
{126}{}{A GECK? That's a Garden of Eden Creation Kit, a kind of gray suitcase looking thing, right? I haven't heard anyone mention one of those in... well, since... almost forever.}
{127}{}{NEED Gechkkk}
{128}{}{Desliga}
{129}{}{Do you have one?}
{130}{}{Mind if I ask you something else?}
{131}{}{Well, never mind then.}
{132}{}{Hate to break it to you, friend, but we don't have ours anymore. Used it up to make Vault City...*poof.* All gone.}
{133}{}{NEED Gechkkk.}
{134}{}{Desliga}
{135}{}{Oh... well, do you know of any place that might have one?}
{136}{}{Mind if I ask you something else?}
{137}{}{Well, nevermind then.}
{138}{}{Well, hmmm. Here's your problem, as I see it: the GECK's an old piece of tech... pre-war tech, in fact. You just can't "find" them anymore. They were only issued to Vaults.}
{139}{}{NEED Valt.}
{140}{}{Desliga}
{141}{}{Do you know where I could find any other Vaults?}
{142}{}{Mind if I ask you something else?}
{143}{}{Well, never mind then.}
{144}{}{You could go scan the Vault Central Computer, see if it has any coordinates for any other Vaults. I doubt it, but no harm in checking.}
{145}{}{Well, if you had access to our Vault Central Computer, you might be able to find some mention of some other Vaults. But only Citizens are allowed in the Vault.}
{146}{}{Tanques}
{147}{}{Mind if I ask you something else?}
{148}{}{Obrigado pela informação.}
{149}{}{Hey there, welcome back. Anything I can do for you?}
{150}{}{Sure. What's on your mind?}
{151}{}{Gechkk?}
{152}{}{Desliga}
{153}{}{Que lugar é esse mesmo?}
{154}{}{Do you happen to have a GECK in stock?}
{155}{}{Valerie over at the maintenance shed could use a new wrench and some pliers.}
{156}{}{Councilor McClure said you'd have a... uh, hydro-magneto-thingie that I could have for the Gecko power plant.}
{157}{}{Councilor McClure said you'd have a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator in stock that I could have.}
{158}{}{The First Citizen sent me here to claim my reward.}
{159}{}{Nothing today, actually.}
{160}{}{This is the Amenities Office. Got your typical stock... basic living necessities, some books, "how to" manuals, some tools, stimpacks, medical supplies, this and that.}
{161}{}{Sounds great. Can I see what you have in stock?}
{162}{}{Do you have a GECK?}
{163}{}{Valerie over at the maintenance shed could use a new wrench and some pliers.}
{164}{}{Councilor McClure said you'd have a... uh, hydro-magneto-thingie that I could have for the Gecko power plant.}
{165}{}{Councilor McClure said you'd have a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator in stock that I could have.}
{166}{}{The First Citizen sent me here to claim my reward.}
{167}{}{Mind if I ask you some other questions?}
{168}{}{I may be back some other time.}
{169}{}{Well, sorry to break it to you, but I'm only authorized to do transactions with Citizens. No offense to you, but it's the rule, you know? You might try Happy Harry's out in the Courtyard.}
{170}{}{Well, sorry to break it to you, but I'm only authorized to do transactions with Citizens. No offense to you, but it's the rule, you know? You might try Happy Harry's out in the Courtyard.}
{171}{}{How can I become a Citizen?}
{172}{}{But... uh, I am a Citizen. Don't you remember me?}
{173}{}{Look, my money's just as good as any Citizen's.}
{174}{}{Councilor McClure said you'd have a hydroelectric magnetosphere regulator in stock that I could have.}
{175}{}{The First Citizen sent me here to claim my reward.}
{176}{}{Mind if I ask you some other questions?}
{177}{}{Certo. Tchau.}
{178}{}{You can take the Citizenship test. Proconsul Gregory gives it to any Outsider who wants to become a Citizen. You should probably talk to First Citizen Lynette first, though. She kind of runs the show around here.}
{179}{}{All right. Where is she?}
{180}{}{I see. Mind if I ask you another question?}
{181}{}{Thanks for the information. I'll go look for her.}
{182}{}{Ela está no Prédio do Conselho... saia do prédio aqui, vire à direita e continue descendo a rua passando pelo parque. Você deve chegar direto nele.}
{183}{}{I see. Mind if I ask you another question?}
{184}{}{Thanks for the information. I'll go look for her.}
{185}{}{Sério? Não posso dizer que me lembro de você. Tem algum documento com você? Isso esclareceria o assunto.}
{186}{}{Não, eu não os tenho comigo agora.}
{187}{}{Sim. Aqui está.}
{188}{}{Deixa para lá. Falo com você mais tarde.}
{189}{}{Bem, deixe-me passar pelo leitor aqui, e vamos apenas garantir que tudo esteja em ordem. Não vai demorar, mas um momento.}
{190}{}{O qu-?! Hey! Devolva esses documentos!}
{191}{}{Uh... na verdade, não tenho tempo para comprar nada agora. Me deixe pegar os papéis de volta e vou embora.}
{192}{}{Tudo bem. Tenho certeza que está tudo em ordem.}
{193}{}{Bem... uh, tudo bem.}
{194}{}{Se importa se eu te fizer algumas perguntas?}
{195}{}{Vejo você mais tarde.}
{196}{}{Tudo confere, pegue de volta seus documentos. O que posso fazer por você?}
{197}{}{Let me see what you have in stock.}
{198}{}{Actually, do you mind if I ask you some questions instead?}
{199}{}{Nothing today, actually.}
{200}{}{So... you're Citizen }
{201}{}{Yeah, he said you'd be stopping by... }
{202}{}{Tudo certo.}
{203}{}{Actually, never mind, I'll come back later for it.}
{204}{}{Okay, here you go. One Hy-Mag. Kinda looks like a lava lamp, doesn't it? Oh, don't drop it... it's pretty fragile.}
{205}{}{Say, what else do you have in stock?}
{206}{}{Se importa se eu te fizer algumas perguntas?}
{207}{}{Thanks. I might stare at this for a few hours before taking it to the Gecko plant.}
{208}{}{Got it. Thanks for the part.}
{209}{}{Yeah, the First Citizen said you'd be stopping by... Captain. (Winks.) Let me tell you, Captain, you've got a BEAUTY waiting for you.}
{210}{}{Yeah, the First Citizen said you'd be stopping by. Well, let me tell you, friend, you got a BEAUTY waiting for you.}
{211}{}{O que é?}
{212}{}{Actually, keep it for me. I'll pick it up later.}
{213}{}{Nothing less than a Heckler and Koch G11, one of the best assault weapons ever made...(hefts weapon, passes it to you)...fires a 4.7 mm caseless cartridge, 50-round magazine. When it talks, people listen.}
{214}{}{I'll bet. Thanks.}
{215}{}{No problem. Plus, here... have a couple of frag grenades on me. Consider it my thanks for wiping out those raiders.}
{216}{}{Great. Can I see what else you have in stock?}
{217}{}{Posso fazer mais algumas perguntas?}
{218}{}{Thanks. I'll put them to good use.}
{219}{}{That'll do it for you, then?}
{220}{}{Mind if I ask you some other questions?}
{221}{}{Yeah, that'll be it for today.}
{222}{}{Yeah, I know. I'm still waiting for the requisition lists to clear the server, but it's going to be a while. Don't know what to say. Things just take time.}
{223}{}{I see. Mind if I ask you some other questions?}
{224}{}{Maybe I can go find those tools somewhere else, then.}
{225}{}{!}
{226}{}{, huh? Wait one minute, and I'll go get you the Hydroelectric Magneto... uh, the Hy-Mag.}
{227}{}{, right? Wait one minute, and I'll go get you the Hydroelectric Magneto... uh, the Hy-Mag.}
{228}{}{Obrigado.}
