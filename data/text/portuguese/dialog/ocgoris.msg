{100}{}{Você vê uma figura vestida com uma tunica.}
{101}{}{Você vê Goris, o estudante.}
{102}{}{Você vê uma figura humanoide vestindo um manto com capuz de mangas compridas. Há algo antinatural em sua
 postura, mas você não sabe exatamente o que é.}
{103}{}{Olá, eu sou Goris. Não te reconheço; você é novo aqui?}
{104}{}{Eu}
{105}{}{Eu vou.}
{106}{}{Sim, e daí?}
{107}{}{Ola. Eu sou }
{108}{}{Olá, Goris. Gruthar disse que eu deveria procurá-lo. Ele acredita que você é o homem com
 as respostas.}
{109}{}{Posso te fazer algumas perguntas?}
{110}{}{Desculpe, tenho que ir.}
{111}{}{É um prazer conhecer você,}
{112}{}{Então você falou com Gruthar. Ele tem uma opinião bastante exagerada sobre mim. Eu realmente
 não sei a metade do que ele pensa que eu sei. De qualquer maneira...}
{113}{}{Então você é o estrangeiro! Eu vi alguns como você; alguns estão aqui na Vault, mas você
 parece diferente, você parece ser mais 'experiente', se é que me entende. Aposto que você já esteve por
 aí um pouco e fez muitas coisas. Estou certo?}
{114}{}{Uh... 'experiente'?}
{115}{}{Eu vou.}
{116}{}{Desculpe, mas acho que vou embora.}
{117}{}{Sim, já tive algumas aventuras. Diga, se você não se importasse em responder algumas perguntas para mim,
 eu poderia lhe contar algumas das minhas aventuras em troca.}
{118}{}{Não é da sua conta.}
{119}{}{Se importa se eu te fizer algumas perguntas?}
{120}{}{É um acordo! Eu adoraria ouvir qualquer coisa que você possa me dizer.}
{121}{}{Além disso, eu não poderia recusar um amigo de Gruthar.}
{122}{}{O que você gostaria de saber?}
{123}{}{O que faz aqui?}
{124}{}{Você é prisioneira aqui?}
{125}{}{A Quanto tempo você esta aqui?}
{126}{}{O que você pode me dizer sobre os deathclaws que estão por aqui?}
{127}{}{Você sabe o que aconteceu com as pessoas que moravam aqui na Vault?}
{128}{}{O que você pode me dizer sobre Gruthar?}
{129}{}{Você acha que os deathclaws são uma ameaça aos humanos?}
{130}{}{Você tem alguma informação sobre essa Enclave de que falou?}
{131}{}{O que você sabe sobre esse vírus?}
{132}{}{Você mencionou que queria fazer algumas viagens. Que tal se juntar a mim?}
{133}{}{Desculpe, mas tenho que ir agora.}
{134}{}{Hmm... Estou surpreso que Gruthar não tenha contado a você sobre mim. Ah bem. }
{135}{}{Eu sou um tipo de estudante. Estou tentando aprender o máximo que posso sobre o mundo
 e as diferentes culturas que se desenvolveram. No momento, estou estudando a cultura que os
 deathclaws estão formando e comparando-a com o desenvolvimento humano em linhas semelhantes.
 Adquiri quase todas as informações de que preciso aqui. Ajudaria muito minha pesquisa se eu pudesse
 viajar um pouco. No entanto, não quero ir sozinho, entende.}
{136}{}{Interessante. Posso te fazer mais algumas perguntas?}
{137}{}{Então, você é um estudioso. Isso é uma grande conquista no mundo de hoje.}
{138}{}{Que tédio. Oh, bem... é a sua vida para desperdiçar como quiser. Mas eu preciso de mais informações.}
{139}{}{Não, posso sair quando quiser. Não fiz porque não quero viajar sozinho. Sou muito durão
 e sei cuidar de mim mesmo, mas ainda seria uma pessoa sozinha no deserto se alguma coisa
 acontecesse.}
{140}{}{Eu vejo.}
{141}{}{Ah, covarde demais para fazer isso sozinho. Eu entendi.}
{142}{}{I don't like traveling alone either, so I can't blame you.}
{143}{}{Uh... a few months actually. I came here from the coast a while back.}
{144}{}{Wow, you're pretty new here yourself. If you don't mind, I need to know more.}
{145}{}{You weren't long on that answer. Care to tell me more?}
{146}{}{I see. I need to ask a couple more questions.}
{147}{}{These aren't your average deathclaws, as I'm sure you noticed. They've had their intelligence
 enhanced by some means not understood by them. It was done by a group of humans known as 'The
 Enclave.' It seems this Enclave needed an army and they chose deathclaws because of their ferocity,
 physical prowess, and... well, you get the picture. Anyway, the only thing lacking in deathclaws was
 their intelligence. They needed to be smart enough to understand complex commands, but not so smart
 that they'd be a threat to 'those in charge.'}
{148}{}{That sounds like the biggest crock of shit I've ever heard in my life!}
{149}{}{That's incredible. You seem very knowledgeable. Can I ask you more?}
{150}{}{Hmm... Okay.}
{151}{}{::sigh:: They were captured by The Enclave. Gruthar and the pack were forced to aid in their
 capture. They had no choice since they were slaves at the time. The fate of the humans has weighed
 heavily on Gruthar's mind. He's never really forgiven himself for his complicity in the affair. The
 humans were taken alive, but who knows what has happened to them since?}
{152}{}{(Sigh) They were captured by a group called 'The Enclave.' Gruthar and the pack were forced to

{153}{}{Hmm... I need to ask some more questions.}
{154}{}{Eu sabia que essas pragas de deathclaws tinha alguma coisa a ver. Eu preciso de mais informação.}
{155}{}{Sometimes we're forced into doing distasteful things by situations outside of our control.
 Gruthar should learn to forgive himself.}
{156}{}{Gruthar is not the monster that he appears to be. He genuinely cares about all of us here, and
 is doing everything he can to ensure our safety and survival. All of us trust him with our lives. I
 don't know what else I can say about him. You would have to get to know him and judge for yourself.}
{157}{}{I'll not make any snap decisions about him. He deserves better.}
{158}{}{Sure. Let's talk about some other things.}
{159}{}{He's a deathclaw. I find it hard to believe that he can have any redeeming qualities.}
{160}{}{Well... the potential is there, especially when you take their new intelligence into account.
 However, I don't think that Gruthar and his pack pose a threat. They all seem to respect life and
 personal freedom above all else. Now, I don't expect you to take my word on this. I would ask you to
 judge for yourself. There are others who live here whom you can ask your questions.}
{161}{}{Only a dumbass would fail to see the threat potential of these deathclaws!}
{162}{}{Thanks for the advice; I will ask around. Can I ask you a few more questions, though?}
{163}{}{Hmm... Okay, how about a few more questions?}
{164}{}{No, only what I've told you. Wait, there is one other thing. The Enclave showed an interest in some ruins to the west of here. Why, I don't know. That's about it.}
{165}{}{Well, every little bit of information helps, and I thank you for it.}
{166}{}{This happens to be a very important subject to me and you've let me down!}
{167}{}{Eu vejo.}
{168}{}{I think it's called the FEV virus. The Enclave is, or was, doing extensive research on it. I'm
 sorry, but I don't know anything more.}
{169}{}{That's okay; on to other things.}
{170}{}{You should be sorry. I was told you were a font of knowledge!}
{171}{}{You've been more than helpful, Goris.}
{172}{}{I've kept my part of our bargain and answered all of your questions. Now, how about those
 adventure stories you promised?}
{173}{}{Gladly. It's a pleasure to talk to you.}
{174}{}{Promise? What promise?}
{175}{}{Sim, com certeza.}
{176}{}{(Goris hesitates and you get the feeling you are being carefully scrutinized.) I would be
 honored to join you!}
{177}{}{(Goris hesitates and you get the feeling you are being carefully scrutinized.) I'm sorry, but I
 don't think that you and I share the same ideals. A joint venture would not be in our best interest.}
{178}{}{Okay, you lose.}
{179}{}{I understand. Perhaps you'll reconsider later.}
{180}{}{What? I'm not good enough for your company? Screw you!}
{181}{}{Ok, I understand.}
{182}{}{I have nothing to say to you. Do not bother me again.}
{183}{}{I asked you not to bother me again. Perhaps violence is the only language you understand.}
{184}{}{}
{185}{}{Yeah, you know, well traveled... knowledgeable... experienced... You don't have a clue what I'm
 talking about, do you? }
{186}{}{Food seasoned, not me.}
{187}{}{Eu vou agora.}
{188}{}{Uh huh. Well, your IQ may be smaller than your shoe size, but you obviously have something
 going for you to have survived in the world this long... Ok, let's try this. Me want leave this place.
 Me want travel with you. Ok?}
{189}{}{Uh huh. Well, your IQ may be smaller than your shoe size but you obviously have something going
 for you to have survived in the world this long... it must be that mean streak I can sense in you. Oh,
 well. Good-bye.}
{190}{}{Uh... Ok.}
{191}{}{Eu vou.}
{192}{}{I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry into your private affairs.}
{193}{}{Yeah, well, see that you don't do it again!}
{194}{}{Whatever. I need some information from you, though.}
{195}{}{I'm sorry, Goris. I'm a bit jumpy today. I wanted to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.}
{196}{}{You have had some interesting times. You are the stuff that heroes are made from, and I
 envy you. Thanks for telling me everything.}
{197}{}{Well... you are a walking quest for carnage, and I think I'll be going now. Thanks, and bye!}
{198}{}{You're welcome, Goris.}
{199}{}{Hello again. What's up?}
{200}{}{You come me?}
{201}{}{Uh... me lost. Me go.}
{202}{}{Just thought I'd stop by and say hello. See ya later.}
{203}{}{Hey, I'm looking for a traveling companion. You up for it?}
{204}{}{What can I do for you,}
{205}{}{You bad thing! Why no tell?}
{206}{}{You're a deathclaw? Is there a reason you didn't mention this to me?}
{207}{}{How do I put this... Bad thing you kill, no talk. Me not tell you so you see me good thing. Not
 kill me. Okay me stay with you?}
{208}{}{I'm sorry to have deceived you, but humans have a habit of shooting deathclaws on sight. I felt
 that it would be to my advantage to hide my identity until you could see for yourself that I am on your
 side in this venture. If you want me to leave, I'll do so. But I would rather stay and help you on your
 quest. I want to show that humans and deathclaws can work together as friends, not enemies.}
{209}{}{Me not like, you go.}
{210}{}{Okay, you stay.}
{211}{}{I'm sorry, but I don't like being deceived. You should leave.}
{212}{}{I understand why you felt it necessary to hide your identity. I think we can work together, so
 please stay -- but don't deceive me again, Goris.}
{213}{}{. Me new here.}
{214}{}{. Yes, I'm from outside the vault.}
{215}{}{.}
{216}{}{?}
{217}{}{So, the Enclave started messing with a virus, or some such thing, and injected the deathclaws
 with it. This virus was known to mutate humans into some sort of super beings, so the Enclave wanted
 to see what it would do to deathclaws. Well, the result was a breed of deathclaws so smart that they
 could see they were destined for slavery. So, they played dumb until they could gain their freedom.
 And here they are!}
{218}{}{Sou contra atacar qualquer deathclaw.}
{219}{}{I suddenly sense that my pack is in trouble. I am sorry to leave you, but I must check on my brothers.}
{220}{}{Tudo bem.}
{221}{}{The security cameras recorded what has happened. You should go check it.}
{222}{}{Você vê um deathclaw cinza. É Goris.}
{223}{}{You see a humanoid figure wearing a long sleeved, hooded robe. It's Goris.}
{1000}{}{Yes,}
{1001}{}{Você se cura.}
{1002}{}{Você espera aqui. Eu voltarei logo.}
{1003}{}{Uh... no weapon now. Okay?}
{1008}{}{You D'claw? Why you no tell?}
{1009}{}{Eu terminei.}
{1010}{}{Você deve curar-se agora.}
{1011}{}{Eu preciso que você espere aqui até eu voltar.}
{1012}{}{Make sure you don't have a weapon ready, Okay?}
{1016}{}{Vamos lá.}
{1017}{}{You're a deathclaw? Is there a reason you didn't mention this to me before?}
{1018}{}{É isso por agora.}
{1019}{}{I'm healed and ready to go,}
{1020}{}{I'm almost completely healed,}
{1021}{}{I'm mostly healed, but I could use some assistance when we get the chance,}
{1022}{}{I've healed myself as much as I can, but I'm still pretty badly hurt,}
{1041}{}{I'll be waiting here for you when you get back,}
{1060}{}{I do my best to look inconspicuous,}
{1064}{}{Você ficar perto.}
{1065}{}{Você não se afasta.}
{1066}{}{Você muito perto. Espalhe.}
{1073}{}{Ficar perto de mim.}
{1074}{}{Não fique muito longe.}
{1075}{}{Devemos espalhar um pouco.}
{1078}{}{É isso por agora.}
{1079}{}{I'll stay as close as I can,}
{1098}{}{I'll move out a bit and give you room to breathe,}
{1117}{}{I'll hang back and give you some room,}
{1136}{}{I'm sorry,}
{1137}{}{I've learned a lot from our travels together. I'll gladly come with you, }
{1156}{}{? }
{1157}{}{. }
{1158}{}{, but you've got too many people with you now. I'll wait here until a position opens.}
{1159}{}{I think I will do better on my own.}
{1160}{}{Your not anyone I want to be around I am leaving.}
{1161}{}{I wish to avenge my brethren.}
{1162}{}{All right. Let's do it.}
{1163}{}{Maybe you should do this one on your own.}
{1164}{}{You right we kill.}
{1165}{}{You go alone.}
{1166}{}{Lets change up the distance between us.}
{1167}{}{Me think you need to move different.}
{2000}{}{I think I broke a limb. Medical assistance is required.}
{2001}{}{I believe I am suffering from radiation poisoning. Do you have anything to aid me?}
{2002}{}{I believe I have been poisoned. Do you have anything to aid me?}
