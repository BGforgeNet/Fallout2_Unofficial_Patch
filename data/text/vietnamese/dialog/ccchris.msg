{100}{}{Bạn thấy một ông già.}
{101}{}{Bạn thấy Chris, người trông coi trạm xăng.}
{102}{}{Bạn thấy một ông già ăn mặc lôi thôi trong chiếc áo choàng màu tím.}
{103}{}{Chào chào, người lạ. Ồ bé yêu ơi! Xem bộ bánh xe này. Bao năm rồi mới lại
thấy một chiếc. Lão Chris có thể giúp gì nhỉ?}
{104}{}{Chào chào, người lạ. Chưa thấy cậu ở đây bao giờ. Lão Chris có thể giúp
gì đây?}
{105}{}{Đây chỗ nào?}
{106}{}{Ngộ tìm Navarro. Đây phải không?}
{107}{}{Ông thấy chim sắt bay ở đây?}
{108}{}{Ông có nghe Enclave? Họ đây?}
{109}{}{Ngộ chỉ ngó quanh.}
{110}{}{Đây là nơi nào?}
{111}{}{Tôi đang tìm Navarro. Có phải ở đây không?}
{112}{}{Ông có nhìn thấy cái máy bay trực thăng nào bay qua đây không?}
{113}{}{Có từng nghe đến Enclave không? Họ có ở quanh đây không?}
{114}{}{Tôi chỉ ngó quanh đây thôi.}
{115}{}{Đây là chỗ của tôi, của Chris. Đây là trạm dịch vụ – chưa từng nhìn thấy
trước đây, trong tạp chí cũ hoặc đại khái thế à? Đó là thứ này – một
trạm dịch vụ.}
{116}{}{Ngộ tìm Navarro. Đây phải không?}
{117}{}{Ông thấy chim sắt bay ở đây?}
{118}{}{Ông có nghe Enclave? Họ đây?}
{119}{}{Ừ... ngộ phải đi.}
{120}{}{Tôi đang tìm Navarro. Có phải ở đây không?}
{121}{}{Ông có nhìn thấy cái máy bay trực thăng nào bay qua đây không?}
{122}{}{Có từng nghe đến Enclave không? Họ có ở quanh đây không?}
{123}{}{Xin lỗi, phải đi.}
{124}{}{Navarro? Lâu lắm rồi chưa nghe thấy cái tên đó. Căn cứ quân sự cũ ở phía
Đông Nam của San Fran, đi tuốt về phía Nam cơ.}
{125}{}{Ngộ đến đó. Không phải Navarro.}
{126}{}{Okay. Ngộ cám ơn. Ngộ xem đó.}
{127}{}{Ông lừa ngộ. Ngộ biết Navarro đây. Ông nói thật hoặc ngộ làm ông xin lỗi!}
{128}{}{Tôi đã ở đó và chỗ đó không phải là Navarro.}
{129}{}{Okay, tôi sẽ đến đó xem. Cám ơn.}
{130}{}{Ông nói dối. Tôi biết là Navarro ở đây. Nói thật đi hoặc tôi sẽ cho
ông một trận!}
{131}{}{Huh? Uh... Well sure it is. I heard tell of it a while back! Navarro
 military base, southeast of San Francisco.}
{132}{}{You lie me. Me no got patience. You tell truth or me make you sorry!}
{133}{}{You lie. I don't have the patience for this. Tell me the truth or
 you'll be sorry.}
{134}{}{Fuck you! (takes a radio out of robe) You want to see sorry? I got
 some boys who'll show you a whole new meaning for the word! (starts to turn the radio on)}
{135}{}{Me kill you dead!}
{136}{}{What you do now?}
{137}{}{Me gone.}
{138}{}{That's a bad move, partner.}
{139}{}{What do you think you're doing?}
{140}{}{Hey, I'm outta here.}
{141}{}{(speaking into radio) Alert! We got an intruder at the station! Alert!}
{142}{}{[XONG]}
{143}{}{Well, nice talking with you. Here's some advice though - ain't nothing
 in these parts except wasteland and radiation. Civilization's south of here. I'd be heading that way if I was you.}
{144}{}{Cám ơn.}
{145}{}{Metal birds? Oh, you must mean vertibirds. Now why would you be
 asking about them here?}
{146}{}{Vertibirds? That's an interesting subject. Now why would you be
 asking about them here?}
{147}{}{Shaman say metal bird take village, fly Navarro. Me try find.}
{148}{}{People interested. Me try find for them.}
{149}{}{You know about? What you know?}
{150}{}{The shaman of my tribe told me these vertibirds stole our people.
 I'm here to find them.}
{151}{}{I know some people who are interested in vertibirds. I'm trying
 to locate them for them.}
{152}{}{So you know about vertibirds. Tell me what you know.}
{153}{}{Shaman? Look here; if your shaman says he sees things flying around
 and scooping up people then he's been sniffing too many herbs. Got it?}
{154}{}{Hakunin great shaman. If he say he see then he see.}
{155}{}{Hakunin was a great shaman. If he says he saw vertibirds, then he
 saw them!}
{156}{}{Well, that doesn't mean anything to me, but in case I see one of
 these vertibirds, whom should I be telling?}
{157}{}{You tell me. Me be around.}
{158}{}{Tell Shi.}
{159}{}{Tell Brotherhood of Steel.}
{160}{}{Tell Hubologists.}
{161}{}{Take pick. You tell Shi or Brotherhood of Steel or Hubologists.
 Everybody interested.}
{162}{}{You tell me. I'll be around.}
{163}{}{You can tell the Shi.}
{164}{}{You can tell the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{165}{}{You can tell the Hubologists.}
{166}{}{Take your pick. You can tell the Shi or the Brotherhood of Steel
 or the Hubologists. Everybody seems to be interested in vertibirds.}
{167}{}{The Shi, huh? Well if you say so. I'll send word to 'em down in
 Chiny town. Meanwhile, I got things to do.}
{168}{}{Wait. Me have strong friends. They say Navarro here. You tell
 where or things get messy!}
{169}{}{Wait a minute, pal. Obviously, I've got some powerful friends and
 they tell me Navarro is here. Now you tell me where or things will get messy!}
{170}{}{The Brotherhood... Uh, yeah, well, I'll do just that. Meanwhile,
 I got things to do.}
{171}{}{Wait. Me have strong friends. They say Navarro here. You tell
 where or things get messy!}
{172}{}{Wait a minute, pal. Obviously, I've got some powerful friends and
 they tell me Navarro is here. Now you tell me where or things will get messy!}
{173}{}{The Hubs? Yeah, sure, I'll send word if something comes up.
 Meanwhile, I got things to do.}
{174}{}{Wait. Me have strong friends. They say Navarro here. You tell
 where or things get messy!}
{175}{}{Wait a minute, pal. Obviously, I've got some powerful friends and
 they tell me Navarro is here. Now you tell me where or things will get messy!}
{176}{}{Damn, that's a hell of a list... Uh, well, if something comes up
 I'll... Yeah, well, I got some things to do.}
{177}{}{Wait. Me have strong friends. They say Navarro here. You tell where
 or things get messy!}
{178}{}{Wait a minute, pal. Obviously, I've got some powerful friends and they
 tell me Navarro is here. Now you tell me where or things will get messy!}
{179}{}{Uh... Hey, I'm just told to shy off visitors and such. I don't want
 the kind of trouble you're talking.}
{180}{}{Then tell best way in base... now!}
{181}{}{Then I would suggest you tell me the best way into the base... now!}
{182}{}{I suppose that would be through the trap door in the floor of my room.
 Just go and leave me be.}
{183}{}{Được, ngộ đi.}
{184}{}{All right. I'll do that.}
{185}{}{I know they fly over here from time to time. They're usually heading
 south toward San Fran. If you're interested in vertibirds, I'd head there.}
{186}{}{Okay, me try there.}
{187}{}{Me have friends who want me find vertibirds. Friends say vertibirds
 come here.}
{188}{}{Okay, I'll head that way.}
{189}{}{Look, I have some friends who want me to find vertibirds. They say
 they come from here.}
{190}{}{Enclave? That a group or something? That don't ring no chimes
 with me. What you want with 'em?}
{191}{}{Me want join.}
{192}{}{I want to join.}
{193}{}{Join up? You're a tribal! What makes you think they'd want a tribal?}
{194}{}{Join up? You're a tribal! What makes you think they'd want a tribal,
 and his posse no less?}
{195}{}{Me serious. Me join Enclave.}
{196}{}{Me serious. Me Join Enclave.}
{197}{}{I'm serious. I'm looking to join the Enclave.}
{198}{}{I'm serious. I'm looking to join the Enclave.}
{199}{}{Wait a minute, dummy. Are you trying to say you're one of the Enclave
 replacements?}
{200}{}{Wait a minute. Are you trying to say you're one of the Enclave
 replacements?}
{201}{}{Ừ... vậy à.}
{202}{}{That's right.}
{203}{}{Damn. Sorry for the hassles. I'm supposed to clear a bunch of newbies
 coming through here but I got to weed out the trash. Anyway, just go up to the gate,
 through the woods there, and give 'em the password. It's 'sheepshead.' Oh, and stay on the path!}
{204}{}{Thanks!}
{205}{}{Wait a minute, dummy. Are you trying to say you're one of the Enclave
 replacements? If that's the case, then why aren't you alone?}
{206}{}{Wait a minute. Are you trying to say you're one of the Enclave
 replacements? If that's the case, then why aren't you alone?}
{207}{}{Uh... escort?}
{208}{}{I hired an escort!}
{209}{}{Well, I don't mean to be rude or nothing, but this here's private property.
 If you're going to be poking around somewhere, don't be doing it here.}
{210}{}{[XONG]}
{211}{}{You're back. What can old Chris help you with?}
{212}{}{You tell me Navarro south. You lie! Me here for truth.}
{213}{}{You told me Navarro was to the south, old man. Now I want to know the truth.}
{214}{}{You look familiar. Old Chris thinks he's seen you before... Nope, can't be.}
{215}{}{Intruder at the station! Send help!}
{216}{}{Sound the alarm!}
{217}{}{Intruder alert! Intruder alert!}
{218}{}{Die, scum!}
{219}{}{The Enclave will promote me for killing you!}
{220}{}{Die, outsider!}
{221}{}{What the...?!}
{222}{}{You use radio and me make you sorry!}
{223}{}{You use that radio and I'll make you sorry!}
{224}{}{Fuck you! You want to see sorry? I got some boys who'll show you a
 whole new meaning for the word! (starts to turn the radio on)}
{225}{}{Me kill you dead!}
{226}{}{What you do now?}
{227}{}{Me gone.}
{228}{}{That's a bad move, partner.}
{229}{}{What do you think you're doing?}
{230}{}{Hey, I'm outta here.}
{231}{}{Yeah, right.}
{232}{}{He's pulling out a radio. He's going to alert the whole base! I've got to deal with him quickly.}
{233}{}{Oh, no. Man pull out talkie box. He tell on me. Must stop him.}
{800}{}{You conned Chris to give you the password.}
{810}{}{You killed Chris before he could warn the base.}
